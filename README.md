Hello Reader,

Please note that all projects in this folder are presented as-is directly from when they were completed during my Data Science Immersive Course in 2020-2021.

While I will eventually clean up these projects for a possible future portfolio, I feel that it is important to showcase a copy of the original works. This is both as a snapshot of what was taught during the DSI course, as well as a yardstick for any future projects/reworks.

Thank you for your attention.

Regards,
Mok Teck Ching
