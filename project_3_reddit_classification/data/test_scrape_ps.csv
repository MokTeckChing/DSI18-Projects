Oh boy... How long ago did this take place? Maybe 1 or 2 years ago?

A little bit of backstory, i did **NOT** come from a impoverished background. Nope, pretty much the opposite. Though, i (at least i think) did have a somewhat hard childhood. My parents divorced and i was left with my mom. My mom was really nice, but did yell quite a lot. Then a few years later, i was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease! Its called Junevile Dermatomyositis or something like that. Anyways, i spent a good amount of time in the hospital in 3rd grade. In the 3rd grade i also made a friend who lets call asshole. Asshole was actually an ok person when he was young. Though, he did cuss a lot, which was a bad sign. Idk WHAT happened to him over summer, but it changed him. He was just an innocent little kid, and then over summer, transformed into a stuck up, spiteful, greedy kid. He used to take things from me, emotionally damage me, and straight up tossed me to the ground! Basically, he manipulated me into his personal puppet. I'm not digging that deep into this kid, because you probably know the gist of it. He made my life worse.

**THE REVENGE**

I think you're gonna like this. So after 5th grade, we drifted away and made new friends (or in his case, a posse). He was an ass to me and took my food. Now, I'm naturally a HUGE snitch, but that changed a lot in 5th grade. I changed this behavior, whether for the better or worse, and powered through 5th and 6th grade with terrible academics. 7th changed this for me and I got pretty much straight A's. Lets get back to asshole. Again, he used to steal things from me and i was determined to stop him. I studied what he stole from me and what he didn't. After a month i figured that he goes after my sweets. Oh boy, did i know what to do. I always watched this company that sells crazy stuff. They also sold something called the ""Worlds Hottest Chocolate Bar"". Its basically a chocolate bar that spicier than **CAROLINA REAPER!** Holy shit, if this backfired I would be pissed. This is what happened. I bought the chocolate and its packaging was a bit too revealing, so i put it in a plastic bag and went to school. I waited till Asshole came over to steal again. When he was in close proximity, i casually took my bag out with the chocolate. This is the gist of the dialogue that played out(with OP instead of my name of course.):

Asshole: ""Hey OP, whats that?""

Me: ""Oh this? Its a very fancy chocolate bar.""

Asshole: \*snatches bag and runs off\* You're poor, i should have it!""

The next part was just plain funny.  Me and my friends ran to view this awesome event. He at the WHOLE thing. That was not part my plan. You were only supposed to eat one square, eating the whole thing, you could die. I honestly thought he would eat one square. See, he's a two face and he like to give things he stole to his mom and dad. The next thing i knew, he was coughing, gagging, and throwing up. He had to go to the nurses office, but other than that and extreme traumatization, he was fine. That, apparently, did not cause a parent conference. Now that i look back at it, was that a good thing or a bad thing. I think the reason is that i didn't offer it to him. Nevertheless, he did not bother me ever again. (Also my mother grounded me for a month, but worth it!)

My mom follows through and her cousin gets a favorable settlement.

My mom kept trying to get her to pay what she owes, but her cousin never even paid one cent. after the divorce, her cousin moved to another state, so she probably assumed she no longer had to worry about my mom asking for the money back. Cousin still came to our state a few times throughout the year to visit other family that she was close with.(important later)

My mom ended up attempting to sue my cousin due to still not receiving a payment after over 2 whole years, but cousin ended up not even showing up for the court proceedings. My mother, reluctant still to this day as to whether she did the right thing, went through her cousin's history and dig up a lot of small things that had been overlooked, even some things that had not been brought up to law enforcement.

The choir takes the form of an after school club, but you earn half a credit for it. The vocal class is like the choir, however, it has an actual curriculum and full credit. I am in both the choir and vocal class, as are some other kids in the music program. This particular story takes place during the vocal class. 

 Let me tell you the tale of Anita (Not her real name, but similar).

 Anita was our substitute teacher one day in early December of my freshman year. We were really cramming trying to learn our Christmas songs before the annual Christmas concert, due to some complications resulting in a few choir practices being cancelled. When we walked into the classroom to see a sub, we were all a bit worried as we still had so much to do in so little time.

 It was fine, I thought, as long as she has the right qualifications. Nope. Her first words to us were basically that she had no music qualifications and she had previously been a scientist before wanting to switch paths to teaching. Oh boy, now we had to try and learn these songs with no competent conductor. Annoying, but if one of us played the practice tracks our teacher had made on their phone it should be doable.

 So we began using the practice tracks and singing our Christmas songs, specifically one of the more religious ones. Anita stops us. ""Would you like to know the meaning behind this song?"" she asks.

 ""No thank you, we have to get these songs right before the concert,"" I reply, along with some other students. Apparently, Anita didn't hear us. She begins her great sermon.

 She literally started preaching to us about God and how we are all going to hell! In the middle of class! In a room filled with mostly atheist teens! I'm a Christian, but I absolutely hate it when others force their religion down people's throats. I tried to tune it out, thinking she will soon stop.

 I was dead wrong. Anita went on and on, and she kept repeating that we were all going to hell and that we had to repent to Jesus or face eternal damnation. One guy kept sort of egging her on, asking questions and trying to have a debate of religion. We all kept begging the guy to stop, that we didn't want to waste the class.

 10 minutes. 20. 30. Anita would not desist. I'm pissed, others are pissed. I'm beginning to hate my own religion. Anita is relentless, with more passion and intensity than the priests at my church. This went on for the entire class. Some kids got so offended (Due to either being atheists or having other religions) that they walked out of class.

 In hindsight, one of us could have left the room and told the principal, but we didn't. I think we all just thought she would stop eventually. When the dismissal bell rang, my heart sank. We had just gotten one of our last practices stolen from us, and we were still severely underprepared for the performance. 

 The entire class was fuming. Normally, if we had a bad sub, we kept it to ourself as it wasn't worth the trouble. This time though, we knew this was a serious issue. It had to be against school rules. We all unanimously decided to report the incident to our teacher the next day, as he would have the greatest reason out of any staff in the school to deal with it.

 When we all told him, we spared no details. A couple of kids had even recorded the incident. He. Was. PISSED. I had never seen this man angry or anything other than cheerful and calm. His face turned red and he stood silent for a moment. He began saying things through gritted teeth like ""She wasted all of our time"" and ""That is the most unprofessional and inappropriate thing that I have ever heard of."" He said a lot more, but I can't recall them all as this was a few years ago. 

 The teacher talked to the Principal, kids gave testimonies and showed the footage. The principal went to administration. Etc. Etc., investigation, yadda-yadda.

 The next day our teacher informed us that thanks to all our evidence and testimonies, Anita was no longer allowed to be a substitute teacher at any school. In fact, she would never be able to get any teaching job or even earn her teaching degree. Yeah, she definitely broke a lot of rules.

 Anita is kind of a legend in the music department now, but if you bring it up to the teacher, he still starts to look a little angry.

 Moral of the story: Don't preach to teens.

Anyway...

This was one of my earliest dating experiences in life. I met somebody I was rather quickly interested in, asked her out, got a yes, and decided on one of my favorite places ( a nearby habache grill place. Higher end, outside of my where I belong financially but I planned from pulling from savings so it was fine. ) we met up, talked a while then went to our reservation.  

Everything went rather fantastic, she seemed a bit distant at times but I figured it was just hunger and what not. We talked a bit seemed to have a lot of shared interests, etc, the works. 

She went to the restroom and left her cellphone face up on the table. 

 This is where the hard turn happened. 

I saw a text chunk pop up from a friend of hers. "" did you get the idiot to pay for your meal yet..."" or something along those lines. Don't quote me. I... snooped a tad, seeing another chunk of the conversation, and well... she wasn't even remotely interested, she just wanted some free food from some "" loaded idiot "". I slowly dropped her phone into her drink, grabbed my stuff and left. Left with with a 139$ bill. I went home, picked up a bottle of jack, and slowly worked on that across 3 days.

About 5 days later she sent me an angry message calling me a scumbag and such from her new phone, her father sent me some messages, as did her brother. I ended up informing her father of what transpired, and he surprisingly apologized, did the same with her brother and he still said he was gonna kick my ass, heh. ( I'm heavily summarizing here. )

I found out some years later whilst snooping about that her father ended up writing her out of the will, supposedly for this and other things she did that was like it.

I gave her ample training and even had a seasoned person, we'll call her Becky, sit with her (essentially making sure she doesn't mess anything up). We finally got to the point where it's sink or swim time and she sank. 

Months go by without hearing from her and all is well. Until last week when had to pick up my brother. My brother is on methadone and he goes to the clinic once a month to pick up his medicine. No big deal, i bring him down all the time. I sit outside and wait he does his business and we go.

I come into work that same day and Becky pulls me side. ""Hey I want you to see this before it becomes a rumor."" It was a picture of me standing next to my very identifiable me truck, with a conversation that explains that Sarah has a business relationship with the clinic and how since I'm here i must be a client. 

Becky by all means is no angel. She has her finger on the pulse of the drama at my work. So this isn't necessarily good news for me. While there's nothing to be ashamed of by seeking help, i would prefer it not be associated with me.

Since Becky is a peer and not a subordinate it wouldn't effect things to badly but the fact that she loves to gossip and have people pay attention to her, i know it'll be spread. The only people that matter will believe me I'm not going to explain it to my subordinates and hope they believe me. 

I explain the basics of my visit and pull the only thing i could out of my ass to prevent Becky spreading these rumors that she's claiming to want to stop (even though she's the only person still in contact with Sarah.) Knowing Becky isn't the brightest I quickly say it's a violation of HIPAA to spread healthcare information of a person or their family to anyone let alone their workplace. I tell Becky I don't want to involve her because she only received the message and request her to screenshot the conversation and send it to me. 

With screenshots in hand i go outside and call the clinic. Provided Sarah's full name and the screenshots. I mention my very limited knowledge of HIPAA and express how upset I am that someone that has any offical connection to the clinic would take pictures of me, my vehicle and send them to my workplace. 

Turns out that it was a violation of HIPAA as well as a violation if an even more stringent law that has to do with addiction treatment. It's been ran up to the powers that be. I've been told that her professional relationship with that clinic will end and, they would be willing to bet that, she wouldn't be able too be involved in any aspect if her field.

This is going to be a long and hefty story, but I don't know who else to turn to.  All my friends tell me that ""the best revenge is living well"" but I dont know.  I just cant shake this feeling of wanting to do something drastic.  I might be selfish for wanting others to hear what I have to say, especially because I know there are stories on here that deserve a lot more outreach, but I'm going to share it anyway.  Here is my story.

When I (20F) was younger, I looked up to everyone on my mom's side of the family.  They were all very pretty, very rich, went to very prestigious schools, and were in very happy marriages.  I wondered if i had what it took to become a respected, decent person just like them, and I even hated myself a lot of the time because I didn't think I could do it.  It also didn't help the fact that I was chubby, loud, and not very smart lol.

The twist was that I was actually quite thin (I was 5'8"" 130 lbs), above-average smart although not like the smartest person ever (4.2 gpa, 30 ACT), and also quite accomplished (6th best violinist in the school out of 100 or so violinists + got to play at carniege hall with the symphony for a competition and got first place).  But compared to my mom's side I was fucking nothing so I basically went through high school with 0 confidence in myself to amount to anything special.  

I don't blame my mom's side for my own lack of self esteem, but I do think the high expectations messed me up a little bit.  I had 100% convinced myself that I was overweight and that my grades were shit and I should just stop trying altogether.  So in my last year of high school I gained 25 lbs and stopped going to class.  I lost the confidence to even stand next to my friends and became a total shut-in. 

When I got to college mostly everyone I knew were getting into relationships whereas I thought ""why the hell would anyone want to date someone like me"" (yeah, I know, pretty edgy).  So when someone asked me out for the first time ever I said yes without hesitation and considered myself lucky.  I never said no to him.  Anything he wanted, I would do.  I never complained when he was 3 hours late to everything, made me do his homework, and guilted me into doing sexual shit that I later regretted.  I didnt even say anything when he would victim blame sexual assault victims that came up on the news about the school (he was very religious-right).  Everyone told me to leave him but that was impossible when I had the self-confidence of a dust mite.

When I had finally gained a shred of confidence (aka tired of hearing my friends talk) after 7 months with this guy I threatened to leave him.  He guilted me back into staying by saying he would kill himself if I left.  This happened multiple times.  Until one day my parents found out and got me out of that situation.  He'd leave endless messages, get his friends (who didnt know anything) to leave messages, and even follow me into my apartment building (where you needed a key to get in) late at night.  I had to move just to make it stop.  Eventually, the cops were called but that didn't stop him either.  Serious academic repercussions were threatened which finally got him to stop.

I fell into a deep depression.  I had to drop a class and get an incomplete from another class (basically no grade until you finish the course).  I stopped going to my extra circulars.  I gained more weight.  I lost more sleep.  I made 2 separate appointments with our school's therapists but backed out of both of them last minute thinking I had lived a very privileged life and that I didn't need therapy.  My school is near a forest, so I would always go into the woods at ungodly hours of the pitch-black night and for the most part just wander around wishing I was dead.  But I also used that time to do some deep self-reflection.  Why did I act so submissively during the relationship?  Why did I think all of this was okay?  Why did I feel so guilty all of the time?  I didnt understand why I was so loyal to someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.  After months I ended up tracing back these feelings to my childhood.

My mom's side... although seemingly perfect, were actually very, very religious-right conservative.  As such, most of the women on her side were housewives.  I didn't think too much into it because they all seemed happy.  But whatever the women did, they did second to their husbands.  They didn't speak out of turn, they stayed thin (even if it meant not eating), they listened (or pretended to listen) intently when their husbands would talk about the amazing qualities of Trump.  They all cooked and cleaned.  They chose all the right words to fluff their husband's egos.  At the time I was impartial to politics so I didn't really care if they voted for this person or that person... I was just selfishly obsessed with their image of happiness.  But I started to wonder if this image was real.  Of course, I doubted myself into thinking that I was just projecting my own unhappiness onto them.  But I couldn't shake this feeling that somehow... SOMEHOW... my ex-boyfriend in some ways resembled the men in my family.

And then I found out the truth.

My father (god bless his soul) is a *very* observant man.  He is nothing like the men on my mom's side.  And on the long road trip home after school got out, he decided it was time for me to know everything.  This is what I learned.

My mom has one brother (Adam) and one sister (Lilith).

Adam made his wealth building his own firm which now employs 100+ people.  He owns multiple homes and often takes expensive vacations.  He has 3 children, two older girls and one younger boy.  He sent them all to the one of the most expensive private schools in the nation and the girls were pursuing the least lucrative degrees.  None of them use their degrees now.  But he could afford it so it was whatever.

I learned that most of his assets were a lie.  Half a decade ago, Adam's family was going through some rough financial times.  Any sane person who was financially struggling would stop flaunting their wealth at that point and scrape together their savings while possibly downsizing/selling their homes.  But nope.  He's a real shady guy.  He gamed the system and essentially put everyone's college debt onto their house and foreclosed on the house.  This basically means that anyone who was paying taxes was now also paying for 3 random rich kids's unnecessarily expensive private school tuitions.  

Tbh yeah I sort of get it if times are really tough and you need to do that in order to not die.  But my uncle Adam has no shred of guilt or care for other people.  He only did this in order to keep maintaing his lifestyle and flaunt his wealth.  He didnt suspend his vacations.  He didnt wise up.  He didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.  And now that he doesn't have to deal with all that college debt, he buys a multi-million dollar house in another, more expensive location.  Smh.  And I used to think people who were religious had some sort of moral code.

Now here comes the juicy part if it's not already juicy.

The reason why he was struggling with money in the first place was because 1) 2008 financial crisis aftermath (it was a miracle he even survived it) 2) a few years back he *JOINED A CULT AND SOLD OFF ALL HIS ASSETS AND DONATED IT TO THE CULT*

Often times I see people joking about organized religion and how they're essentially cults.  But this was a legit, illegal, organized, kool aid-esque, mid-sized cult in the city.  They were (of course) preaching about doomsday, and that everyone needed to sell off all their assets in order to be received by god in their naked state.  They also told everyone that they would *handle* everyone's assets for them.  Failure to meet such conditions resulted in your departure to h-e-double-hockey-sticks.

Adam was batshit crazy.  He would try to get everyone in the family to join the cult.  No one did.  He would go into the streets and try to get random people to join the cult.  My dad said he was embarrassed to be seen with him sometimes.  And of course, the doomsdays came and went.  And each doomsday didnt phase Adam one bit.  It wasnt until after the cult leader was arrested that Adam started to snap out of it a little bit.  But even then it took a while for him to realize what had really happened.  He never felt guilty or ashamed for essentially ruining his whole family by falling for this cult.  He held his head high and simply never mentioned it again.  To this day he admits to nothing.

He also did some other less important petty stuff like he would ""forget"" to pay back 5 grand he borrowed from a relative, or insist that his firm did a good job in x when in fact my mom has a degree in x and said that it was done poorly.  When it broke he blamed it on the weather.  Small shit but still indicative of his poor character.

Let's talk about Lilith (thank you for making it this far).

My mom's side had originally immigrated here from another country and like all immigrants started off poor.  Lilith met a man (Richard) who was studying to become an engineer at a college where she was studying to become a doctor.  This man was on a student visa from the same country my mom's side was from.  His parents were damn wealthy.  They did the architecture for some of that country's biggest universities.

Unfortunately she became rather ashamed of her poor family.  I figure that hes largely responsible for this bad mindset.  He came from a very *traditional* family in a very traditional country.  His mother was the pinnacle of a perfect woman in that society.  She was pretty, fair-skinned, and *very* submissive.  Total woman of the household.  She did all the cooking, cleaning, and never got a degree.  She didn't need one.  She took care of the children while her husband earned the money.  Dont get me wrong, I think this is fine.  But you have to really want this lifestyle.  You shouldnt be guilted into it by some ancient system that cant keep up with the times.

Thus, the man is considered the bread and butter of any household in our culture.  And Richard was that plus he was a rich asshole.  I suspect he made Lilith feel bad about her upbringing.  She stopped attending my mom's side's family events for him.  He never even introduced himself to her family.  Thats a huge HUGE disrespect in ANY culture.  And the worst part... *she changed courses to pharmacy because he told her being a doctor was too much work for girls.*

My dad later found out that this was all because he realized bioengineering was too hard for him so he switched to orthodontics and tried to get Lilith to do pharmacy so that he could still look like the bigger man.  He also tried to get my mom, who was in dental school at the time, to drop it entirely because dentistry is too much work for girls.  My mom (god bless her fucking soul) was like, ""nah"".

This dynamic continued into their marriage.  Lilith ALWAYS puts her husband first.  One time she didnt show up to my niece's wedding because it was his nephew's BIRTHDAY.  Also hes a hippocrite.  He always advocates for the woman to not work but he keeps Lilith working because her pharmacy gives her health insurance and she put him on it.  She probably earns more than him but she still gets his hand-me-down cars.  She never gets to take trips (its typical for husbands not to let their wives go on vacation out of jealousy).  She never gets to see her family.  She has to listen to all his political rantings about how Trump is the most moral person ever.  And how the church did nothing wrong and all those cases about high catholic figures molesting young children are isolated events.  He has his group of friends who think the same way as him, and they all tell his son to find a submissive wife like his mother.  And he is someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.

Oh also, he likes to preach to everyone about his accomplishments but its like.  Your parents gave you everything all you had to do was go to school and follow the path.  How could you ever compare to your wife, who started in this country speaking no english, in a poor family, graduated top honors, paid for it all herself, and flourished into a great career?  Idgi.

I wont go on but it doesnt end here.  Most of the women on my moms side dont have technical degrees.  Im not trying to be disrespectful towards those degrees, however this means its a lot harder for them to make money.  I looked up to all of them for the happiness I thought they had, but behind the veneers they all have piece of shit husbands who treat them lesser than.  They wont let them go out because theyre just that jealous.  They wont admit that the women are probably a lot smarter than them.  They encourage their daughters to get wealthy husbands instead of lucrative degrees.

I hate it.

I hate how whenever they come over they try to teach me lessons about living a good and honest life.  I hate how they can just live everyday acting as though they didnt just fuck over a lot of people.  I hate how they think they deserve their wealth and respect.  Like.  You.  Literally just ruined your family by making them join a cult.  And you never learned from that.  You effectively took away a womans career in order to make yourself feel more like a man.  How could I ever respect you.

And I had grown up respecting these people.  I had been taught through these subtleties how to act around men.  I had been taught through watching my role models and receiving teachings at family functions that I needed to be skinny, get a non-lucrative degree, find a rich husband, shell out some kids and pray to god everyday.  And this shame that a lot of the women on my moms side probably feel everyday is what i got a small taste of when I was with that man who resembled the men on my moms side.  I never want to feel that shame again.

SO...  What do i do.  I almost have my life fully together now in the wake of dating that guy.  I lost like half of the weight I gained in all that depression from high school and on (to be healthy, not to be skinny).  My classes are fine again, and Im on track to graduate right on time in the summer.  I switched over to a technical degree.  I dont have a job lined up yet but Ive done a few internships and im very certain ill have a well-paying job before graduation.  Ive found my friends again and im living well.

But i still have this burning need thats been going on since summer.  This need to *do something*.  I dont know what that something is.  Something that would let them know I made it without their stupid ass teachings.  Some major ""fuck you"" to every idiot who thinks women are meant to have babies and thats it.  Something that would allow my aunt not to hate her damn family anymore.  Maybe thats something she needs to figure out for herself, but ahh what can I do to help???

One day my dad told me this outrageous theory.

His theory was that she was gonna get a divorce.  He said that she doesnt rlly care about all that trump stuff and he has a crazy idea that one day in the next 10 years or so shes gonna realize she only has x amount of days left on this earth and shes gonna think ""man i cant spent the rest of it catering to this guy"" and straight up leave.  I think thats awesome and I want to be able to support her.

So 50% for my aunt and all the women in my family, 50% for my own selfish reasons, I would like to stage something grand.  Dont tell me that ""no you need to live your own life and be happy"" because ive already thought about this and as long as it benefits me and others in the long run, i would probably very much enjoy doing it.

What do i need to do?  No matter how unreasonable, id like to hear your thoughts.  Shoot for the moon and youll land amongst the stars they say.  Do i need to become rich?  Do i need to mess with them somehow (nothing outisde of the law lol)?  I wanna hear your thoughts reddit.  By the way, as i said no one thinks much of me in the family.  This is good as it gives me as it keeps me under the radar, but bad as i currently hold no power within the family.  Thats why I say i want to slow cook a massive revenge plot and reveal what ive done by the time im 30.  That gives me about 10 years.

Thank you for reaching the end omg ;;;(((

I was raised to respect the ""Law Enforcers"" and to never seek revenge.

First off, I have so many run-ins with bad cops. It's to the point where I am beginning to hate them all.

Second, I do not agree with revenge. But, I do enjoy hearing about someone else.  Even telling the story of someone else.

So this happened to my friend, Stacy. She's a pretty girl going to college. She lives three hours from the college. Don't ask me why...

It was around 10:00 PM she was still around an hour away from home. Cop pulled her over. She would not tell me the full details of her conversation with him. But she did give me the short sweet version of it. 

He accused her of running the Stop Sign and gave her a $200 (it was a bit more than that) ticket. 

He was looking at her chest giving hints of ""wanting something"" as a trade to remove the ticket from ever existing. Long story short, she showed him her boobs just to get out of the ticket.

Every time she drives down that street pass that Stop Sign, he would pull her over and it will be the same thing. She started taking a different route because of him.

Her friend, Crystal, who is a young pretty girl as well, was going to visit her. The friend has a dash cam, when a cop comes, she leaves it on, but hides it out of site. Well, that same cop pulled her over. She was polite to him, but refuse to do anything. She took the ticket and drove off. 

 Crystal used the dash cam as evidence to sue the police station. On the dash cam, he gives her a choose. She can show him the ""goods"" or get a ticket that could hurt her record.

They fired him, but that wasn't good enough for Crystal. Both Stacy and Crystal, some how was able to get this police officers home address. Not sure how, but that is not what important. 

To start, they slashed the tires on both his vehicles. They sprayed painted bad cop on his house walls.

They used Gorilla Glue on his doors. Gorilla Glue, when it drys, can stick anything to everything. 

This cop wasn't getting out of his house easily.

So, here’s some backstory. When I was thirteen and I’m middle school, I had a constant bully who I’ll call Melanie for this story. Melanie wasn’t apart of my friend group (emo, because I was thirteen and in a phase), but she wanted to be. She would listen to my friend Raven (not her name, obviously) at the time about all the piercings she wanted to get and then get them directly the next day or afterward. One time, Raven even said she wanted to get her nose pierced, when she didn’t, just to see if Melanie would do it. Sure enough, she did.

In regards to her bullying though, she bullied me because I was fat, and didn’t have enough money to buy alternative-style clothes like she could. When I say bullied, I don’t mean she would just call me names or something silly. She would throw me into lockers, spit on me, steal my writing journal (which I wrote very personal things in) and read it in a dramatic voice at the lunch table, and cyber bully me. The bullying got so bad I even attempted suicide when I was fourteen because of it, and had to switch high schools. Even when I switched high schools, the bullying continued up until I was sixteen years old, in which she promptly dropped off the face of my earth, which was heavenly.

Fast forward until I was seventeen. I reconnected with an old friend who I will call Sydney. Sydney was with a guy who I’ll call Issac for over two years. The had attended prom together, had a wedding planned out, and Sydney was pregnant with Issac’s child. However, during her pregnancy-brained hormones, she snapped and hit Isaac across the face causing Issac to break up with her. Sydney was devastated and Issac, for understandable reasons, refused to speak to her. 

Sydney is a bit of a wild card, so she hacks into Issac’s profile on Facebook and discovers that for the past year Isaac has been cheating on her with, guess who? Melanie. I get war flashbacks as she’s telling me this, and Sydney is livid. She calls and confronts Issac, who simply laughs and states how he loves Melanie and didn’t want to be with Sydney anyways. Sydney is, once again, hurt. 

Now, I don’t support what Sydney did, but I was red with anger. Melanie had hurt me so very much, and now her, a sixteen year old girl was with Sydney’s twenty year old boyfriend. What made it worse is that Melanie knew about Sydney, knew about her being pregnant, and encouraged Issac to cheat on her.

Que the pro-revenge.


Part One: The planning.

I retch out to Melanie and very calmly apologized for any wrongful doing that I had caused her in the past. Melanie, though skeptical, agreed to start trying to develop a friendship. Thus, we started talking. This went on for quite sometime, up until I discovered some very personal details about her. The main detail was that she had a premium Snapchat in which she was recording videos of her having sex with Issac for money, performing oral, and ultimately just selling nudes. Nothing wrong with this, unless you’re a minor. And oh boy, she was. She added me, another minor at the time, to her premium Snapchat for free and I watched and gathered as much evidence as I could on my phone without having pictures or video evidence of this. I wrote her Snapchat name down and gave detailed statements of everything that happened in these videos. She then added me back on her private Instagram page where it showed pictures of her smoking pot (it’s illegal in my state, unfortunately), and shooting up heroine. It even showed her doing cocaine. She was a self-proclaimed “hippy” and liked to brag about it. I took all photographic evidence and video evidence I could of this and continued being her friend. 

Melanie apologized “profusely” for what she done to me in middle and high school and invited me to her graduation. I attended, mainly because I had nothing better to do, and that’s when I discovered she was pregnant with Issac’s baby. Perfect. That was enough evidence I needed alone to fuck her and Issac’s life all to hell.

Part Two: The Revenge.

I called an anonymous support hotline for children’s sexual violence and gave my name, and statement. Then, I honestly forgot about it. Then, around the time of my eighteenth birthday four months later, I get called into my local police department for an interview. I gathered all the evidence of my revenge and took it to the interview with my mother disapprovingly watching the entire time. Afterwards, I get a call from Melanie telling me she is having a boy. Wow. Congratulations. 

Part Three: The Outcome.

Within the next month, I get a court summons and I have to testify against Melanie in court. Melanie has sense been arrested and put in a juvenile detention center and when she saw me walk into that courtroom, her eyes went wide and she had to be detained because she tried to leap and attack me. I testified against her, and then had the option to sit and watch the whole thing go down.

Melanie was sentenced to five charges of possession of illegal narcotics, and one count of distribution of child pornography. She was then sentenced to the rest of her minor years in juvenile detention where she will promptly be taken to prison to serve a whopping 17 years and five months in prison with probation after release, and no chance of parole. I later found out Issac was charged with statutory rape and was sentenced to 15 months behind bars with chance of parole. Though I’m not certain, I’m pretty sure her child had to be put into foster care, due to Melanie’s parents also being incarcerated. 


Sydney gave birth to a healthy baby girl, and though we’re not friends anymore from unrelated issues, she thanked me profusely after finding out what I did, and I couldn’t be more satisfied either.

In that amount of time, Gary had completely Ruined theap James and the hit had taken 4 hours to build. I then banned him, but the story doesn't end there. I go into the logs to write a warning list (we do this in case a contestants is wrongfully eliminated or banned) I found out that Gary had sent the girl who called me, James, and the hit death threats and even said he was gonna report James to me admin abusing, and here's where the revenge happens, ""we were, and you completely abused your powers."" I said to James,
James had began to scream at me saying it was his ADHD that made him do it, this wasn't the first time he did it, he was also demoted once because he began to use his powers on game to save his partner from eliminations, and it was considered rig due to the guidelines.
I said he needed to stop using that as a excuse as I also had ADHD, turns out the same level as him, and when I got mad I turned it to emotional abuse cause I knew giving the pain to anyone else would be terrible, he says he would tell a guy, let's call him John, that I admin abused him and I would be banned from his game, now some background on John, John had a YouTube channel and was the owner of one of the biggest roleplay groups of the same roleplay on the game, he then blocked me and began to tell John what had happened, Now, I happened to be in John's server and immediately checked to see if he was online, wait a minute, I forgot to mention that Gary worked at John's game and was even a supervisor.

I am decently proud of my creativity and ability to stick with something so absurd.

 **Hope this gives you a laugh. Here we go:**

Not a super malicious story, but definitely rude/undesirable/inconvenient. I am a female and was about 16 years old at the time.

My mother is a devout Southern Baptist. Her church preaches ideals that I do not agree with. They don't approve of gays (I have stayed a closeted bi-sexual around her), they say masturbation is bad (? god shoulda made ur arms shorter if he didn't like that), women cannot be elders, etc. To me, these are major issues.

Mom made us go to church just about every Sunday from the day I was born until that fateful day. We went to an 8:30 A.M., hour-long service where the preacher did his thing and then we attended Sunday School for about an hour. I was a teenager, angsty, trying to figure myself out, and desiring more independence. I became tired of having to attend a church whose core values I firmly did not agree with. So, one Sunday I refused to go.

This pissed the living shit out of her. We argued for a while and then she decided to punish me by taking away the door to my room. I very much so value my privacy, as I am the only female sibling and my father was the stay at home parent. Also, privacy is just nice. We were not allowed to have locks on our doors so it wasn't like she couldn't barge in.

I thought this absolutely ridiculous, so I retaliated. I got butt naked, stood in my open doorway and made loud, strange noises- meowing, groaning/moaning, barking. This naturally drew her attention, only for her to find me naked. This absolutely appalled her and she had no clue what to do. She told me to get dressed, so I did NOT, just continued my charade. My dad eventually came up to see what the hell my noises were about and I yelled, ""I AM BUTT ASS NAKED"". I was fully prepared to bend over and moon him if he actually got to the doorway. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to upset them with a view of my arsehole. My dad immediately gave up and insisted mom return my door. She argued for a while and eventually, and quite begrudgingly, gave it back. She made me put the door back on (she was perfectly able to take it off), additional rudeness on her part. 

This only took about 30 minutes. 

HA! I WIN! It is totally feasible to weird someone out enough that you get your way. \~Weirdness manipulation\~

When we met she was really sweet and we had a lot in common. Same taste in music, movies, worked at the same theme park (it’s a big place which is why we never ran into each other at work) and we got along really well. Early on in the relationship she made it known to me that I was her first... well everything. First kiss, first date, first boyfriend, and I was the first person she slept with. Understanding this I told her honestly that I was honored and will do my best to give her the best relationship possible, I didn’t want to ruin guys or anything for her. Also, because of me being her first we talked IN DEPTH that if she ever wanted to leave me and see what else is out there (experience other guys) she had the total right to do so. If we weren’t meant to be we weren’t meant to be. 

Anyways, we dated for about 6 months. Most of her friends had moved away to college the year before so she quickly latched onto my friends who welcomed her with open arms, I love my friends they are the best. For most of our time together it was great. We did get in a couple arguments from time to time but nothing bad, just your basic “I want you to buy me flowers more often!” “Babe I just took us to San Francisco last week and paid for the whole trip. I’m kinda broke right now.” “We’ll that isn’t a valid excuse” whatever, things like that basically that we ended up solving. I greeted her everyday with kisses and hugs and instantly asked how was school or work. 

Right around the end of our relationship, I could tell it was coming to a close by the way she stopped looking me in the eye when she talked to me, she was spending more and more time with her “co-workers” after work. In specific one guy we will call Andy, to be honest I don’t even remember his name.         (Backstory on ANDY): this guy invited me and my ex to his place with some of our other friends for drinks one night. Me and him were getting along and he mentioned how his ex just cheated on him and he didn’t understand how anyone could ever do that to someone *ALERT REMEMBER THAT BS*. I saw him constantly looking at my EX and sitting right next to us and talking to her. This made me uneasy.       (back to the main story).  My ex told me one day that Andy was taking her to the gym and she asked if I was ok with it. Me knowing the mind of a guy instantly said “I am not comfortable with that because I don’t trust his intentions” she then combats that statement with “Oh grow up it’s just the gym what could possibly happen, plus he is just a friend.”  Being that this was all over text there was not much I could do besides say no. She ends up going to the gym with Andy. At this point I should mention we both have each others locations programmed into our phones because we would hang out until late and when the other would leave to go home we wanted to make sure that the late drive home ended safely. I checked her location the day of the gym and saw she was in fact at a gym. Some relief. I was sort of proud of her because she used to be fairly big and was trying to lose weight, mainly by starving herself which I constantly disproved of and as a former track athlete was trying to get her to go on runs with me all the time. 

This pattern or gym stuff kept happening, and I was starting to be ok with it. UNTIL I start noticing she is hanging out in a parking lot for hours on end after work. This brought back my uneasy feeling. This continues for about 2 weeks until it’s the evening before our 6 month anniversary, I had lined up reservations at a nice Italian place and got us tickets to a luxury movie theater that cost me $60! Anyways, she was supposed to stay with me that night and I’m waiting for her to show up at 4 like she said. 2 hours pass and no word from her so I check her location. She is in the parking lot again. Starting to get worried I message our friends if they have heard from her. They said no and asked what was going on. So I explained. I didn’t want to be nosy so they offered to drive by the parking lot as they were only a couple miles away from it at the time. BOY WERE THEY IN FOR A TREAT. 

I was not there for this so this is all from my friends. They found her car easily as it was one of the few. They pulled up and walked over to the car to find my ex having sex with Andy! They apparently got into a huge argument with who were at the time our friends saying “How could you do this to OP? He has been nothing but kind to you!” Then my ex would say “Stay out of my business, why are you creeps even her. FUCK OFF, and don’t tell OP any of this or else!”

This came as a shock to me when they called. I had a hunch, but still... needless to say when she finally did arrive I forced her to come clean. Her first response was “I am so sorry you weren’t suppose to know.” Haha ok whatever.  I asked how long this was going on and she admitted about a month. That got me mad.  I was staying calm but inside I was burning up. Remember I told her if she felt like she needed new experiences that was fine and I’d be ok breaking up for that. I brought this up and she said “well you treat me so well I thought you wanted us to stay together forever thats why I did this I needed out.” So me clearly being the only logical person in this conversation at the tjme said “Then why didn’t you break up with me?” She said that “I didn’t want to break your heart.” So I guess she figured cheating on me for a month was a better option. 

We still saw the movie cuz the tickets were in our names and they were expensive. Plus I’d been waiting to see this movie for a while. It was a good movie, but bad company. She pulled the typical “let’s just be friends” and ended up dating Andy. Who if you remember had just been cheated on and couldn’t understand  how someone could do that... hypocrite. I even reminded my ex about that and said “He knew we were happy but still slept with you after he got cheated on, I wouldn’t put it past him to cheat on you so be careful.” She just said I was full of it. Ok honey whatever you say. 

Our friends despised her but due to her convincing ways she kept managing to be invited to social events with the rule of she couldn’t bring Andy. This went in for about a month until she called me saying that Andy threatened to dump her is she kept hanging around me. Cue revenge plot.  “Oh no really? But we are friends I though?” I said over the phone while a huge grin came across my face. “We are and I don’t want to lose you.” This is getting way to easy. So I decide that maybe we should hang out just the two of us every now and then. She didn’t seem to mind. I hated every second of this but knew it was gonna be great in the end. 

I do this for a few months and even meet this girl who lived pretty far away but was nice so I drove up to spend a weekend with her. My ex was not happy. 

She was with Andy and his family in Vegas and called me while I was with this new girl. 
“Andy just yelled at me in public I can’t believe him.” 
She was crying heavy but I was with this new girl and she was in the other room so this had to be a quick convo. 
“Uhh ok I’m sorry to hear that why did he yell at you.” I said annoyed. 
Crying she said “it’s because I keep talking to you.” 
I started to laugh but stopped myself “ok then why are you talking to me now?” 
“Because you’re such a good friend I needed to tell you and talk to you about my problems.”
“Well I’m with a girl right now so I gotta go.”
She got furious 
“UMMM EXCUSE ME WHY ARE YOU WITH A GIRL??!!!”
I was so confused “What do you mean? I can do what I want I’m a single guy.”
She kept screaming and eventually I could hear her say word for word “You are still mine and will always be mine!” 
I hung up on her crazy ass. And sat back down with this new girl.

Things ended up not working out with new girl which was fine. 

No less than 5 days later I get my ex crying over the phone AGAIN.
“Hey ex what is it this time.”
“*sob* *cry* *sniffle*”
“Uh hello?”
“Can I come over”
Hell no bitch
“Absolutely not what happened?”
I had a feeling where this was going and I had an expensive beer in my fridge waiting for this exact moment but I didn’t expect it to be this damn good. 
“I found Andy in bed with one of my coworkers and he dumped me!”
Ahahahaha you don’t say.
She went in saying how it’s cuz she kept hanging out with me whenever she could. 
“Well,” I was about to put the final nail in the coffin, the few words we all wanted to say growing up, “I. Told. You. So.”

Hangup
Revenge completed. 

Eventually all my friends blocked her, she lost her job, and ended up with a heroin addict.

She was actully the one who arranged a met up and came along as a buffer.

And we had a long talk about what happen and agreed we were all bad people. 

I apologize to Miles for what I did I realize now that I had no right to do that. No matter how hurt I was.

He apologize for being a dick to me for pretty much the whole time I knew him. And for sleeping with my boyfriend 

Blake of courses apology for cheating on me and leading me on.

We decided that then and there was the last time it would be brought up.
 
Not saying we were pretending in never happen. Just that we decided bring it up wasn't necessary anymore.


We decided start off new and surprising it going well.

Even more surprising Miles and I are becoming really close friends. Werid I know.  It only need a week but o got say this feel a lot better then being mad.

P.s  A lot of people seem co sider about Miles dropping out school. Well he did have to drop out that year he was able to get a scholarship and went back the next year.

Here are the key players:

Mom: the hero of the story

Dad: father

Grandma: dad's mother

Grandpa: dad's father

Cool Grandma: mom's mom

My paternal grandparents aren't bad people, but they are, in fact, pretty twisted. The same grandparents who can show themselves to be sweet (well, mostly my grandma) to my sister and I are also judgmental, hypocritical, controlling, and lie. A lot. There are honestly so many stories I can tell but I'll pick the one that humiliated them the most.

My mom has gotten along with them, because she has been a good person to both of them and helped them out when their own children (my aunts and uncles, not my dad) couldn't/wouldn't. She's also not the kind of person to fly off the handle. She plans her revenge.

The details are fuzzy on this part, but what I do know is that my mom got into an argument with my grandma over something stupid. My grandma gets really mad and storms off. Next thing they know, my dad gets a call from his business from one of their workers. My grandpa - who works at the business as an employee - has been cussing about Cool Grandma. Like using really angry, vulgar language. My parents eventually figure out it's related to the argument my mom and grandma had, and that she must've told my grandpa.

My dad confronts his mom, and she ""swears to God"" she never said anything to my grandpa. Grandma says she didn't even talk to Grandpa that day.

Here's the thing: at the time, my parents were paying for their phone bill. Sensing something was up, Mom looked up the bill and, sure enough, Grandma called Grandpa *minutes* after she stormed out of the house.

Remember when I said they were hypocritical? Grandma is a holier-than-thou Catholic. Dad was heartbroken because he realized she blatantly lied to him *and* brought religion into it when she ""swore to God"". My mom was also furious. Not because Grandma and Grandpa shit-talked her, but because Grandpa shittalked Cool Grandma, *who wasn't even there*.

**Cue the revenge**

The next time the entire family fathered - parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, you name it - my mom brought up the argument again. Both grandparents deny it, of course, and start getting defense.

Mom then brings in her laptop with the phone bill information on it, and says to Grandma, ""You didn't talk to Grandpa? You *swore to God* you didn't? Then what's this?""

From the recounting of the tale, mom says Grandma and Grandpa had serious oh shit looks on their faces. Mom cut off their attempts to talk, calling them out on not just lying to their son, but also trying to paint the honest worker who informed on their as a liar, and *especially* for saying horrible things about Cool Grandma.

Mom then *plants* the laptop on the room's main table for everyone to see, and tells the room (first addressing my aunts and uncles): ""Look at your mother, *the liar!*""

Everyone had a chance to look at it, and I don't think anyone tried to defend Grandma and Grandpa for their actions. Those two started apologizing. It was pretty clear it was because they'd be caught and shamed, but there might've been real remorse.

Hello everyone,

I am Mr Wiggly Wiggles. But you can call me Wiggles for short.

Before I tell my story, there are a few things I want to say.

First off, If I say something offensive, I am sorry. But please do us all the favor, and grow up...

Second, this story is true.

Third, this is my first time having an ""interaction"" with a Cop. But not the only time. I have so many interactions with the police and on the most ridiculous things, that my friends and family are calling me the ""Black Incognito"". Please do not ask what it means, it is not important.

With the stories I have about my interactions on police, I am going to be posting more on Reddit.

So now, let us begin this wiggly story of my first interaction with a police officer and my revenge.

Many years ago, when I was 15, my family moved to a good size town. One section was farms, another was wealthy homes, and in the middle was a shopping section. After a week of living there, my girlfriend came down to visit. We decided to walk around the town and check out the stores.

The stores were an hours walk from my house. We went, grab some well needed items, and started back home. We did not have ""Netflix and Chill"", we had ""VHS and Fooling Around"". Do not judge, these were good times. My family was gone for the day, so our goal (mainly my goal) was to get home quickly to begin our fun. For the first time in my life, I was given the privileged of having a TV in front of my bed... AND I INTEND TO USE IT!

So on our way home, when we hit the halfway mark to my house, it starts raining...

We were wearing summer clothes while it started down pouring. Make matters worse, a cop drives by. He spins his police cruiser around in a crazy U-Turn, pulls up next to us, and asks ""can I help you"". My girlfriend is the polite, nice, angle type. So I let her do all the talking. She explained how I recently moved into town and how she was visiting me. Then she explained how we went to the store for some thing and now we are caught up in this down pouring storm. To top this all off, she asks the officer if he could give us a ride home. I guess my girlfriend looks like a major bullshitter, because he did not believe a single word of it. He demanded to see our ID... To appease him, we gave are student ID. Here's a good laugh, they were not good enough for him. HE WANTED ACTUAL DRIVER LICENSE, FROM TWO 15 YEAR OLD KIDS! Not only that, but he tried saying how suspicious we looked. Even gave us some bullshit of knowing every person in the town and since he doesn't know us, that is why we were stopped.

We were in the rain with this douche bag for 30 minutes at least. My name is Mr. Wiggly Wiggles, NOT Mr. Non-Wiggly No Wiggles! For all this time, I could have been home with my girlfriend, doing the Dance of the Wiggly. But no, I get a fat cop that looks like Peter Griffin questioning us in the rain.

So after the interrogation, he apologize, but gave the excuse of doing job for the reason ""WHY"". When my girlfriend gave a second attempt of asking him for a ride home, (don't know why) he apologized and politely said no with a hilarious reason. Not a joke, someone was contacting him on his Talky Toy. So he said sorry kids, there is an emergency at Dunkin Donuts. Then the bastard took off.

Here's is my revenge part. Remember, all actions has consequences. So please do not try this at home.

Revenge: When he was driving away, I lifted up both my middle fingers high to the sky and screamed ""YOU S#$K, YOU F#$K@$G A#$H#$E! YOU COPS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR LICKING S##T AND BULLING!""

Cop did not see it nor hear it. My revenge was complete and it felt really good.

As for the consequences of my action, my girlfriend was pissed. I received no ""VHS and Fooling Around"" and I was not aloud to perform my Dance of the Wiggly. Day ruined....

Hope you enjoy my painful story. Sad part, this is true. I am going to write a book about all my police interactions. Believe me, this is only the beginning.

Sincerely,

Also, this story is not about my revenge, but that of my great uncle and a favorite of everyone in my family.

When my mom was a kid, she had an uncle who owned a turkey farm. He also had a personal vegetable garden where as done might expect with a basically endless supply of good fertilizer, he was able to grow some very large pumpkins. Unfortunately, these pumpkins often gained the attention of the local hooligans and were stolen or smashed more often than not. 

One year, he decided enough was enough and began his revenge plan. He decided he was going to take some of his best pumpkins that year and display them in the front yard (carving my mom and uncle's names in them as a rare nice gesture for them). Before they were even fully grown, however, he prepared the yard with tons of turkey made fertilizer, which is apparently not very sturdy to walk on. He then allowed some grass to grow on it and come October, he was ready to place the pumpkins.

 Late at night, he went out with a bunch of wooden planks, some for the pumpkins to sit on, and two to walk on in order to get to the middle of the yard and back. A few nights later, his plan came to fruition when he heard yelling in the yard. He walked out to his front porch to see a couple teenagers up to their waists in turkey shit and unable to get themselves out. 

My great uncle promptly called the cops to pull these kids out and he never had pumpkins stolen again. 

I never knew this uncle and my mom described him as someone who she never really appreciated until she was much older, but this made him a legend in our family.

But let me slap my Fresh Prince of Bel-Air soundtrack and tell you guys the story all about how, I twisted my Landlord upside down...  
An unspecified number of years ago, I was kicked out of my grandma's house. I had just interviewed for a new job as a store manager at X company and went out into the wild searching for a new place to live quickly. I live in New York where room rentals are very common, rent is a killer here. So I found one of these room rental places in a 2-story building that sort of looks like an old house that was converted into multiple businesses. I walk in, introduce myself to this very nice old lady who runs the place. I tell her I am looking for a room to rent, I'd like a large space with internet access I didn't even ask for anything else because we all know...The Internet is all we need to live baby! She says I look like a nice young man and says ""Well I have a room fitting that description right next door"" I am like ""Oh yeah? can I go see it?"" she tells me it is literally across the hall from her business. She gets up and walks me over opens the door directly in front across the hallway and lo and behold there is indeed a big room with a Queen Size bed, a mini-fridge and super old TV in it. She tells me the tenant that was living there recently moved out and she is renting this room herself, I'd get access to the bathroom (which she shows me next) there's a tub inside the bathroom (of the business) and a very small water heater. She continues telling me the perks would be I'd not have to pay her broker fee since I'd be renting directly from her (who doesn't like saving money!?) and I'd get a private room as the business closes in the evening I can be as loud as I want, bring over whoever I want to my room, and it sounded exactly like the sort of thing you'd want when you first move out of home. Great, I am on-board. Where do I sign?   
I start my new job and new living arrangements almost simultaneously and it was all great. Best feeling in the world for like 1 week, when I run into the first issue. The room had a sink built inside, which I would use to wash dishes and stuff, the pipe was leaking. She had told me she would get this fixed when I initially noticed it the first days there, she said ""Just put a bucket under it. It doesn't leak that much water"". I did exactly that, days later I came home from work to what seemed to be an indoor pool, water everywhere. Fucked up all the new tiles it did, she was across the hall so I threw tons of Bounty down and call her over to see this mess she was like ""Oh no! I'll get someone to come fix that as soon as they are available"" I wait around all night, no one comes, I call out of work the next day so I can make sure this leak doesn't fuck my shit up, my mom comes over to visit and sees the damage and tells me that If she were me she'd drill a hole near the pipe and let it leak downstairs so that the landlord feels more motivated to get her handyman to come and fix this shit. I am pissed off but I'm not 'there' yet, I wait upset but patiently. Her guy finally shows up after I've spent all morning and afternoon dumping buckets of water and checks the pipes, tells the landlord that these pipes are very very old and need changing, she asks him if there's any quick cheaper repair that can be done (of course) and he says he can mend it but eventually it will occur again. First red flag.   
2 months later I am going about my business in my room and BAM the lights go out everything. No electricity. I am confused as fuck this is NY...did we just have a blackout? NOPE. I go out and it's just me by now it is Winter, it is starting to get cold and I have no heating, no lights, no entertainment, nothing. I endure through the night (the business side was long closed). The next day, I go to work as usual bring my phone and laptop charger and everything and call the business from work to inform the Landlord lady that I have no electricity and need that fixed ASAP. It's cold and there's no heating there. She says the same shit from before ""I'll get someone to come out as soon as he's available"" I stress to her the importance of having electricity if nothing else just so that I can turn my electric heater on she says ""oh the electricity works in the bathroom just use an extension in the meantime from the bathroom. I do exactly that and it works somewhat, her extension was one of those where a plug with 3 prongs (not sure what they are called) doesn't fit. So I can't plug the heater but hey....I can charge my phone and of course, I immediately look for a source of free wifi and tho I am cold and completely in the dark, I get by much better than the previous night because the internet is just sooo soothing to the soul.   
By now I've spent 2 nights without electricity and I'm still not hearing about this handyman of hers so I leave work a bit early (being in charge has its perks) and I head home to confront her and demand this fixed. She is being dismissive and can't understand why I'm stressing over this so much. That night I called 411 (or was it 311?) as I sat there in the Dark to report this bullshit to the department of housing. I speak to the Operator and tell her the situation and that I want to know who to report this to, she looks up my address and asks a series of questions and I stress that it's getting colder and I have no heating and no electricity for 3 days now and I'm sick of it. She then informs me that she's having trouble finding my residence and double-checks the address. She then informs me that it seems I am in an area not designated as RESIDENTIAL, this is a business address and I should not be living there as it is illegal to do so, as it is not fitted for living quarters. I am surprised by this and honestly scared so I ask...wait so what happens if I report this situation? She informs me that they'd send an inspector out, the landlord would get in trouble and I'd be made to move out within 3 days after the determination of it not being residential. I had NO FUCKING IDEA that living there was illegal I mean the landlord runs what amounts to a real estate business you would think that they KNOW what is and isn't legal to rent. I am a noob at this, but this news promptly scared me off as I was NOT ready to move out any time soon I had just moved in and it took a LOT of effort bringing all my shit there from home no way was I going to put myself in a position where I'd be forced to move out for snitching. I kept my mouth shut and called my mom for advice. Mom said she'd come over tomorrow and stay at my place while I am at work so I can stress less and she'd ask the landlord lady regarding the repairs. Great.   
4th-day rolls in I go to work, I leave mom the keys. She calls me near the end of my shift and tells me the handyman is here, and he is repairing what seems to be like a short circuit in this odd electric hazard set up that they had (wires were sticking out and shit) he says the wires are old and they rubbed the wrong way so it fucked up everything but he patched it up. I get home and I speak to mom then I speak to the Landlady and I ask her if there will be a discount on rent (mom told me I should demand one) for the inconvenience, the Landlady refused and said there are no discounts, these things happen and If I am that dissatisfied I can just move out. This pisses me off and I inform her that I called and reported this bullshit to the department of housing because it is irresponsible and hazardous. This seems to take her by surprise and she then tries a different approach and speaks to me in a nicer tone, even trying to appeal to me by saying I shouldn't speak so rudely in front of my mother blah blah blah, but I was having none of that shit, gave no flying fucks who was there, I needed her to know that this was NOT cool. I would pay her the full amount of rent but this better is the last time I am left for days without something so essential to living. I then also told her that I wanted to upgrade the bathroom to have a real water heater (the current set up could give you maybe a pint of warm water every 5 minutes...you can imagine showering wasn't viable. Oh, that's right there was NO SHOWER! Forgot to mention that...she had a huge water heating tank but had not installed it because she was looking for someone to install it cheap. Mom stepped in and said she knows someone who will do it and would not charge much the landlady agreed. Mom's friend was a professional and owed her a favor (No...I don't want to know why) and did the work for free for us, but told me to tell the Landlady that he charged me $200 for installing a shower and he'd charge her $200 for the work (this was about a third of the regular price for such an installation) he also was kind enough to properly address the electric hazard so that it doesn't happen again. And informed me that the Landlady insisted that he install an on/off switch for the water heater so that it doesn't consume too much electricity. He explained all this to me when I got home and showed me that he did as she asked but placed the switch on the inside of my room so that I would be in total control of it and that I should never turn it off but it'll get her off my back if she thinks I do.  
After this event, she started being much much nicer, and repairs were taken care of in a decent amount of time. It wasn't all roses, we clashed a bit but to be honest, we started getting along one time she was late on HER rent and she asked me if I could pay my rent in advance, and I said 'sure no problem' went down to the bank withdrew some funds and got her out of her bind. I had a bit of a bachelor pad going and I enjoyed the privacy and being able to watch all manner of internet shenanigans full volume (you guys know...you knooooow exactly what I mean) any how. Things are going great! Then...much like in street fighter...\*HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER\*  
The Landlady's son arrives after I've been living there for over a year and I start seeing him around the office in the back when I pass by to say hello to her after I arrive from work (yeah go figure, that was somewhat part of my routine) moving things along after some months of seeing him lurking in the background. During this time I noticed that the hygiene in the bathroom plummeted not that it was great, to begin with, but it quite literally turned to shit. I would come from work to find a clogged bathroom, all manner of craziness in there I took photos at this point I had started taking photos of the crazy shit I was finding, not even sure when I started but I even started recording conversations with the landlady ""just in case"". So I went to speak with her regarding the bathroom situation and while I am complaining to her about the state of the bathroom (it was never like this prior) her son decides to interject himself into the conversation and tells me that they are NOT responsible for the state of the bathroom and If I don't like it I can go clean it myself and I am confused because #1 - Who the fuck is this guy and why is he getting in the middle of this? #2 - This is YOUR business's bathroom and I am NOT your janitor bro. Fuck outta heaaaa.   
I tell him that I am a Tenant. And I use that bathroom daily and clean up after myself, I expect that at the very least when they exit their business that they leave a working toilet or at least NOT clogged with shit all over. Now we get into a shouting match...well he does, I am recording this conversation so I am keeping my chill as much as I can, he tells me that he is in fact the REAL LANDLORD here and points to a business license certificate under his name on the wall and that his mother simply takes care of the business while he is away on other business or vacationing. I inform him that I've been living there for like a year already and I did not rent from him, I rented from his mother and on top of all this, I've been a great tenant always paying my rent in advance even, and though I was fully aware that they were renting to me illegally after the electricity fiasco, I still paid and behaved appropriately without taking advantage. This infuriates him, he wants me OUT effective immediately, and while he is going on his rant the landlord lady and her husband are trying to be reasonable and talk the ""Real Landlord"" down she pulls me to the side, takes me to the bathroom area and talks to me about the whole illegal rental thing saying ""Yeah it's not illegal for me to rent this, it's illegal for the landlord, but he never comes around but this is our business and we can do whatever we want. But here if the problem is the bathroom being clean we can help each other I'll clean up before we leave and you keep it clean when you are here"" I ask her about this whole ""I am the real landlord here"" business that her son mentioned, she said it's true the business belongs to him but she runs it and he doesn't deal with it but shortly she is planning on retiring and will hand it off to her son's wife who will be taking over within a couple of months to a year. Oh, oh...a year goes by and she informs me of the upcoming changes. After summer she is retiring and her son and his wife will carry on, but that things will remain the same and won't affect my tenancy status, she's spoken to them and it's all good. I am fired from my position as a manager (a story for another day) about 3 months before her retirement. I am broke, my boss screwed me over big time, I can hardly afford to eat, let alone rent. I inform the landlord lady and I put all my energy into job hunting I had enough saved to cover 2 months of rent and I did so but started eating a lot of noodle soup and other $1 meals lol to survive until I got a job (if you don't understand the struggle...count your blessings) August rolls by and I am COMPLETELY FLAT BROKE I can't pay that month at all I let her know that I will pay her in the future when I start working (after 2 years of paying her in advance and doing favors) I had earned enough goodwill that she was okay with this and knew I was good for it. She would retire and I would be owing ""her"" the money but since the new Landlords will be on their independent run, I would need to pay them the rent as usual. Okay, I agree. I finally find a job at the very end of the 3rd month of unplanned unemployment and I start working at the very end of August, after 1 week at my new job I get a call from another place I interviewed at for even better pay and of course I accept, I end up with 2 jobs now and I give no fucks after nearly starving you'd be surprised at how motivated to work you'd be if you knew it would get the bills paid and food on the table. I haven't even received my first paycheck yet when Landlady starts hounding me for her money, ""I know you started working again, and I want to get paid before I retire or soon thereafter"" and I remind her that I just started...usually you have to wait 1 or 2 weeks to get the first check, and she had agreed that I could pay her SLOW since I had to also pay her son the regular rent which I clearly can't pay 2 at a time and there was no rush before when we spoke. She says ""okay she'll arrange with her son so I can deliver payments,"" I tell her I rather not deal with him, and would rather give the money to someone else for her payments. (I wanted to avoid that collision) she agrees and has her niece collect payments.   
Sorry for the long story, I will write part 2 tomorrow. All this backstory is sort of needed to understand the elements of the ""Revenge"" that will come later and how they chipped away at goodwill.

I had only been there about a month and had to call HR about issues...anyways, long story short. I go to HR and complain and a few days later I notice him being noticeable diffrent, nicer etc.

I have a really good sense about when things are going to happen, and I know the company is going to get as much out of me as possible before replacing me.

I checked Craigslist daily and 3 days before my probation period was about to end I saw an ad for my position come up.

I end up calling in ""sick"" when I come back (a day after my probation has ended) im given walking papers and my last check. But they forget to put my vacation time on my check (company policy is that they don't pay out vacation time if you don't pass probation, and the check is dated the day before my probation would have ended)

So I casually wait 29 days and then call HR and inform them I haven't received my vacation time and they owe me a full day's pay for every day since being fired I haven't received my pay.

They tell me they have to check with there legal deparent and make sure blah blah...I tell them that's fine, I have a rep from the labor board and an attorney they can speak with, who I've already talked to..they insist on speaking with there own legal department, cool man that's fine.

I work at Victoria secret so I get a discount and buy some really nice bras I work hard for my paycheck and love taking advantage of my employee discount. My sister in the other had doed not work or save up to buy herself nicer bras. Our family is pretty poor so our clothes tend to come off the rack from walmart. So being able to afford Victoria Secrets bras is a real treat for myself.
But there is one big problem. My sister keeps taking them and wearing with it asking for permission. (Which makes no sense because we aren't even the same cup size. She's a A and I'm a C.)

Now I know she has for sure been taking them because they kept going missing and when I went looking for them I would find them buried at the bottom of her dirty laundry. I've confronted her about this on multiple occasions which her justification is always that I'm being stingy and selfish. These fights always end in a shouting match. Our mom always takes her side saying she's your sister it's just a bra. But to me even though it's just a bra it's the principle of the matter. The last one she ""borrowed"" she ruined in the washer by breaking one of the hooks because she didn't take proper care of it. 

So I decided since our mom wasn't going to stop her I would. I went online and ordered some itching powder and sprinkled it into the cups of one of my bras to teach her a lesson to stop stealing my bras. Whelp she stole the bra as predicted and the itching powder worked a lot better than I anticipated because she scratched herself raw from it. When we got home today she started screaming how it was all my fault that now she has hives and splotchy marks all over her breasts because she scratched herself raw. I yelled back that it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't taken my bra without permission and besides how was she even wearing them without stuffing them because they are too big for her anyway!

I live in a “half double” sort of, but there are 3 apartments in one building (that looks like a regular house). We share the same backyard and all three tenants have a dog. We moved in in this last summer, and shortly after we brought home our sweet soft coated wheaten terrier puppy. The first week we got her, our neighbor reported us to the landlord for him stepping in dog poop. The weird thing is, every since this summer, we haven’t seen that neighbor  EVER take his dog (a little derpy dog the size of a cat) outside to the yard. Never. We have cameras that show the front of the building on the street, and also on the back porch where the lawn is and where our door is and we get notifications of motion on our phones, so when I say we NEVER see him take his dog out, I really mean it. Anyways, last week, I got home from work around 11pm, and I went inside to get the recycling ready to go outside. I put my dog outside on the line during this time, while I do what I need to do. About 15 minutes later, we let Millie in and she’s limping and crying with each step. We are horrified, because there is NOTHING in the yard that could have done this to her, plus she’s on a line so she couldn’t have wandered off. Anyways, while we are checking her out, we get a knock on the door. It’s the police, they say our neighbor called them to report us abusing our dog. We are in total shock. He quickly sees that we aren’t hurting our dog in any way, and leaves. After this we decide to pull up the footage from the camera because at this point we are already putting together something in our head. There is one part of the yard, the part closest to the driveway and my neighbors door, that is not in view of the camera. We see me bringing her out, us going back in, then her walk off camera. All of a sudden, you hear a door open (the only door in earshot of that camera besides mine is his) we then hear footsteps walk down his porch steps, and the steps get closer and louder on the camera, a little movement then my dog crying out in pain 3 different times. We then hear my neighbor say something, sound of footsteps fade and we hear him walk up his porch steps and his door open and close again. A minute later we bring Millie inside. This motherfucker hurt my dog. We brought her to the vet, and he said it was blunt force trauma, like she was kicked at least once, really hard. It’s been almost a week since this happened; she is still limping. The day after it happened, my boyfriend was taking the garbage out and the neighbor went outside and smirked at my boyfriend. My boyfriend said calmly “I know what you did to my dog” and the guy TOTALLY freaks out, screaming and yelling that my dog is stupid. He tried lying and said he came home from the hospital and saw my dog hurt, which is a lie because we would have seen him on our second camera walking down the driveway to his house. He straight up lied and tried to fight my boyfriend. My boyfriend is on probation, has been for almost 4 years. He gets off in a month, but he has a perfect probation record (no violations or anything) so he can’t be fighting the neighbor because of this. My landlord basically said she can’t get involved, and because it’s only audio, the evidence we have is “circumstantial”. I really want to make my neighbor pay for what he did to my dog. She is so very sweet, she thinks everyone is her best friend and she doesn’t even bark at people. She looks like a little 20 lb teddy bear. If anybody has any ideas on how I could get my revenge on a piece of shit animal abuser, please let me know because I really would like to get him back.

So, a little bit of backstory to make sense of this situation. I was raised by an narcissist alcoholic dad and a mom who was too weak to even admit that dad has a problem. I was taken by my country's equivalency of Social Services and placed in a fosterhome. I've lived in 4 different homes, the 3 first neglected me in their own ways. Fourth one was a friends family who graciously took me in. I am very happy here. Anyways: Christmas 2019 rolls in.

I get a snarky invite from my bio-mom to come to the family cabin to celebrate with my biological family and relatives. I thank her but turn it down as there usually is much drama. I wanted to rest, and enjoy myself. Everything goes smoothly and bio-mom and bio-sister comes back. She is gonna drop by and leave some gifts. I am at the teenage phase where I no longer view gifts as materialistic stuff, only as a symbol and kind gesture. I meet up with my mom and she gives me a letter. I see that it's from my hateful grandpa. I ask ""isn't there more from Aunt 1 and 2?""

My bio-moms face lights up with maliciousness. ""No."" I am taken a little aback by this. ""But bio-sister got from both.""  
This was a little bit of a hard-to-swallow-pill, as I am a very respectful person. I just glaze over it, and ask ""I wonder why they would give bio-sister but not me?"" and bio-mom responds ""maybe you would've gotten something if you celebrated with us"". We say good bye and I go to my adoptive family. Ado-Mom sees something is wrong and I explain how my aunts forgot about me. She just nods and carries on, as I go in to my room and break down in tears. I felt so excluded and humiliated. Ado-mom comes in and comforts me as I cry and question why they punish and target me for trying to be reasonable and nice. I see myself as a bit of an intellectual, but I am easily blinded my emotions. Once it was all out, I made my plans. They had wronged me. My bio-mom badmouths me as a mean to cover her own ass to look like a less shitty parent to the relatives. Apparently I wasn't worthy of the symbolic christmas gift. So Ado-mom and me make the moral uppercut. I add the aunts into a facebook messenger group and write ""Hello! Since I didn't come to celebrate up there with you, your gifts are still here. Where should we exchange gifts? Love L"". The key word is exchange. Now they have to sweat, knowing how they didn't bother to think about me, and they can't admit it to my face. So their attempt to be subtle and hurt me failed miserably, I hope, and I wish that they feel ashamed for their actions.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a dummy account to tell of this true story. Happened roughly 8 months ago and resulted in said manager getting fired and with criminal charges filed against them... 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, I previously worked at a multi-national retailers call centre for a couple years during university. When I got hired, I was immediately disliked by two (F) managers. I don't know if I said something while they were around for them to dislike me, but from the moment I started they were gunning for me... Constantly listening to my calls, citing me for silly mistakes I made, etc. It never really stopped but I sucked it up as I needed the money. This went on for about 2 years until it escalated one day...

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a security incident that occurred at work, they spent tens of thousands of dollars upgrading security at our office. This included about 30 new security cameras being installed. This will become prevalent shortly. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day when it was raining, 1 of the managers that disliked me slipped and sprained her foot. I was walking behind her and asked if she was okay. She didn't bother to answer me, so I kept walking to my car. Next day, she's not there. I get pulled into a meeting with HR who have said that the manager accused me of pushing her over, spraining her foot. I called bullshit straight away. HR were having no bar of it and fired me then and there. HR manager and this manager that slipped are very good friends, .so it wasn't worth fighting at the time so I reluctantly left and started to plot my revenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I skipped passed the union representative and called a family friend who's an attorney and we started to plot our payback. The police came to my flat the same day and asked me some questions. The manager had filed a police complaint against me. I told them to wait until my lawyer was present and I would disclose everything. He came over and I told the police everything that had happened. I did not push her, but that she slipped and there was proof of this... One of the new security cameras installed faced the direction where the manager had slipped. I told them to get the security footage and it would prove my innocence... It sure did!

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did the manager who filed a report against me get fired, her HR friend also got terminated from her position. Police charged the manager with filing a fake police report, and she got a $12,000 fine as well as a criminal conviction on her record. I filed a wrongful termination suit against the business and sued them for a hefty sum. I can't disclose the amount I received, but it was a life-changing amount for me. I then took the manager to court and sued her for defamation of character and emotional stress. I also got a nice payout from her. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're reading this, you know exactly who you are. Don't you ever think to fuck with people like that again. I hope you enjoy living in debt for the rest of your life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank-you for reading (if you're still here) lol.

So my classmate (let's call her Alex) stole my geography textbook on a Friday before exams started, because her book went missing. She even scratched my name out and wrote her own name, but it was obvious that the book was mine.
She also tried to cover it up, but failed pretty badly. Me, being a kind person, let her have it for the weekend. But as I went home, I wasn't happy with my kindness. So I decided to ""steal"" my book back on Monday. The geography exam was on Tuesday.

On Monday, when she went to the cafeteria during lunch break (we ate our lunch in the classroom, but you could go to the cafeteria to buy food), I took my geography textbook out of her bag, then gave it to one of my friends (let's call him John), because I knew Alex would suspect me of ""stealing her book"". And, when we were going home, I told John to give my book back (without Alex knowing). The plan worked.

When Alex found out ""her"" book went ""missing"", she started fake crying about how she was going to fail the geography exam. Apparently, she didn't even study geography during the weekend. I tried my best not to smile.

Also, I told another one of my friends too (let's call him Steve). I found out later (after the geography exam finished) that Alex had a crush on Steve, and since I told Steve, Steve now hates Alex. This is when I feared I went too far.

On the bright side, Alex finally decided to stop trying to cover such an obvious thing up. She then apologized to me, and told me I went too far.

I am a 16 year old guy who has severe mental and physical problems because of the asshole in this story.

I was 4 1/2 years old when my parents got devorsed. I stayed with my mom my 3 brothers. 2 months later my mom got together with a asshole named Tim. 

At first he was nice but he soon showed his true colors. He started to beet us for the smallest things. And one time i messed up and he sexual abused when my mom was at her work. And then told me if i told anyone he would kill my family. Thats a good thing to tell a 5 year old. He then also had a kid with my mom.

My mom broke up with him on cristmas. You would think my mom would get my little brother, but no. Everyone in the county knew tim and his family and sided with him in chort for my little brother. And for a year they shared having him. Around the end of this year of insanity they git together again.

He continued to beat us and hurt us when our mom was not home. And he even sexually abused me again and told my the same thing as last time.

The pain and beatings continued. And when i was 10 we moved to a new apartment. The abuse got worse from there. One time i was thrown across the kitchen for forgetting to throw away 1 empty can of beer. 2 months after i turned 11 he woke me up in the middle of the night and sexually abused me again and said the same thing again. 

In may of that year he told me something that motivates me to do what i do. He told me ""it would be better if you killed myself."" He told that to a 11 year old kid. Thankfully im rebellious and now i live to keep others from killing themselves. 

2 weeks later he went on a rampage and beat my mom. My older brother called the cops. And tim tried to say that it was my mother who trasted the apartment and that he hurt her to stop her. Luckly their were 5 witness to back up my mom. We ended up moving away to my gandmas house later that summer.

But thats not Tim's assholeness ends. He ends up making my mom stay in the same city as him or he would take my littlest brother. And for 2 years my mom had to go from my grandmas house to where we lived before. But finale 2 years ago he beat his own son and my own brother. And tried to blamed it on a fake bully.

Hes in jail for one more year and will still have to what 2 more years to even see my littlest brother under police watch. 

My revenge has been whispering in the ears of the one around him. Making tim loss trust of the one around him. He has lost the trust of his family, his new girlfriend, his bosses, and his landlord. So when he does get out of jail he will have nowhere to go. No one to help him.

She would constantly abuse my mom, who was her younger sister, by demanding that she be her slave. ""Fetch me the water"" or ""go buy me lemonade"", all of the time. When my mom didn't comply, she responded by either shaming her on social media or beating her (crazy, right). My mom knew that it would all be over in a few years, so she let my demon of an aunt insult her and beat her - just becoming a servant in my aunt's eyes.

A college degree and a few years later, my mom meets my dad and they have my brother and I. During this time, my aunt didn't get into college because of her stupidity and couldn't hold down a job, because she thought all of her colleagues were there for helping her. She also has a child. I feel sorry for him, knowing all of the abuse he must have received. Anyway, the only time our aunt called us was to tell us how she felt entitled to receiving ""her money"". Pathetic.

Skip forward a few years again, and my brother's 10th birthday is approaching. He is really excited about it, and decides to invite everyone in the family (our parents tried concealing what kind of a person our aunt was). All the family puts money into buying a laptop for him, which he was really excited about because he loved video editing, and getting his laptop was a dream come true. So, our aunt, (EA) and her kid (EK), as well as the rest of the family, arrive for the party.

After making a snide remark about my mom's appearance, EA comes inside. We have a nice lunch, and the time for opening the presents arrived. We had all noticed EA had not bothered with a gift. The look of joy on my brother's face when he opened the laptop was priceless. As you can guess, it wouldn't last. EK starts throwing a fit, demanding the computer and trying to snatch it from my brother. My brother decides to let go so that EK can see the computer. Critical error. The laptop flies out of EK's hands and is destroyed. My brother cannot retain himself, so he decides to cry in his room, as he had loved the idea of getting a laptop.

EA: It's not such a big deal - just a stupid laptop the spoiled brat should've given to EK. EK is so well behaved, such a nice boy.
Dad: That laptop cost a lot of money. Are you going to reimburse it?
EA: Heck no! It's your son's fault he didn't let my poor EK play with it. Doesn't he have a right to have fun?
Dad: He has a right to not getting his property destroyed! He had been looking forward to it so much, and you defend EK?
EA: No one cares about his feelings, the little crybaby. Your children are disgusting and no one cares about them. EK has lots of friends, though. Also, you're irrelevant - I have more Facebook friends than you do!
Mom: At least he can hold down a good job. At least his friends like him!

EA starts hurling abuse and is about to SLAP my mom, when dad, grandpa and I escort her outside. No apology. Fine. When our brother was comforted and the other guests had left, we started to plot our revenge. My mother had had enough and contributes fully to the plan that would land her sister in prison. I remembered her mentioning her facebook clout, and so I checked it out to try and dig up some dirt. Oh, and how much dirt I found. Apparently, EA had been faking needing a wheelchair, probably for some monetary benefits.

So, we do the obvious thing - we pretend to be an association helping the disabled. We ask EA if she is disabled, and, after she corrects her initial no, she tells us she is. We are recording the conversation, and we can clearly hear her high heels walking down the street. We ask her where she is right now, and, after stuttering a bit, she lies by telling us she is at home.

We then compile all of the evidence we need. Photos, videos recorded after her ""accident"" of her not needing a wheelchair. With the help of social media (she is not the brightest tool in the shed), we find all of what we need. We had decided to go after 3 things: 1) her social life, 2) her career and 3) her child. Part 1: Her social life.

Remember her bragging about her Facebook friends? Well, these facebook friends had no idea that she was faking a disability for monetary benefits. We talk to every single one of them, sending them detailed evidence of what she was faking, how she was doing it and for what. 2 weeks later, her number of friends had decreased from 1k+ to 50. I was later told that her closest friends left her, not wanting to be associated with someone who would stoop so low as to fake a disability for some extra cash.

So, with little else to do (she didn't have any hobbies, talking about herself to her friends was her main pass time), she threw herself into work. She started making up for the poor work ethic and all of the insults she had distributed. 2 months in, once we were sure she had poured her life and soul into this new project, we called her manager.

He was very pleased with her progress up to a week ago, where she had apparently made a mistake. He was willing to forgive her because she was trying so hard. Perfect. So, we casually say that she is going to a rave this weekend (we offered EA free tickets for this, and she had accepted the invitation like a fool). We told the manager to be there. He thought that it was impossible, since she was in a wheelchair. We know, we told him.

So, we told him to arrive 15 minutes early and to go to this spot we had identified. EA arrives, insults us and tells her about how amazing she is. The manager sees her without a wheelchair. The conversation that ensued was the most hilarious thing:
M: Having some fun, are we?
EA: Sure! Want to dance?
M: You look oddly... tall.
EA: (still not realising) I'll show you my moves. You're always so grumpy at work (she was drunk) and you need to relax!
M: Firing you will be all I need to keep my mind at peace. How dare you fake a disability? Are you really that terrible a human?
EA's face suddenly turns from happy to horrified, as she realises she ""forgot"" to bring her wheelchair. She tries to bs her way out of this, but the manager is having none of it.

We learn from a very angry manager the next day that, not only has she been fired, but he had blacklisted her. The only industry she had some skills in, she couldn't work in. So, we had taken her friends and career. It was now time to rescue her child. We knew that if she beat up our mom when she was young, she probably beat her son. So, we invite him for a playdate at the aqua park. Although she hates us, she wants us to pay for her son's happiness. We see the bruises on his ribcage. When we confront him about it, he says his mom sometimes gets angry with him and hits him.

We call child protective services, who immediately respond. They take both EA and EK in for some questions, only to find that EA was on heroin. They took EK away from her, as they obviously deemed that that environment was unsafe for a child. The kid is nice, but was raised terribly by his mother. He jumps from foster family to foster family until we offer to keep him. We teach him the importance of being nice, and he became a nice brother. We get on very well nowadays.

All of this is happening while EA is on trial for domestic abuse, possession of heroin and harassment (some colleague complaining about EA's abuse of her). We were asked to testify, and testify we did. We attended the trial, got EA convicted and saved her child. The look on my mom's face when she heard her sister would be rotting in prison for 5 years was amazing. EA is now in her fourth year of jail, and I do not regret a second of putting such a terrible human being in jail.

TL;DR: My horrible aunt bullies my sister for their childhood, and is a pain to everyone who knows her. Her kid &amp; her ruin my brother's birthday party by breaking his expensive laptop, so we dig up some dirt on her to find out she has been faking a disability. We compile a lot of proof and send it to her friends and her boss, getting her ghosted, fired &amp; blacklisted in her industry. We then saved her child from her abuse &amp; her drugs, and took him in. He is now safe and happy.

He would take out his resentment on his students, and because of this, nobody liked him. He was also very creepy, and would stare at the girls boobs and butts. Because of this, many students have reported him to the AP (assistant principal), but because he had been teaching for such a long time, he would always get away with it. Up until my year in 7th grade.

Now, on the first day of school, he seemed like a likable guy. He was nice, and helped us out. But on the second day of school, he changed. He gave us 5 pages of homework, each with about 10 questions on it. He also graded the homework very seriously, and unlike **every other class,** he would grade it based on how many questions you got correct, not on effort. When I got the homework back, I got bad grade. I was confused, as I got the answers straight from the textbook. When I told him about this, he said that there was no way that he graded it wrong. I even showed him the page, but he insisted that he was correct. When he did the same thing again, and I told him about it, he **screamed** at me. When I say scream, I mean his face turned red and the vein in his forehead popped. He would do this to all the boys in his class when they do so much as sit the wrong way. Not only this, but he would also fall asleep during student presentations and then fail us all. He would also bring alcohol in a diet coke bottle to school, and drink from it every day, getting drunk in class. While this couldn't be proven, it would explain why he slurred his words and would lose his balance a lot and fall asleep.

He would do this every day for the entire year. He would assign homework over the breaks, even though he is technically not allowed to do that. That with him being creepy towards the females in the class, and him being biased towards the females too, everybody's resentment of him built up.

It reached a point in the year where nobody wanted him as a teacher anymore. And me, being the little schemer that I was, had a plan.

I recorded his behavior on my phone, through my sweater pocket so that he couldn't see it. Everybody was in on it, nobody told him because we all wanted him fired. The other students who tried to get him in trouble before us never recorded him for some reason. I got **dozens** of videos of him staring at the female students, shouting at the males, and falling asleep during class. Not only this, but I also took one of his diet coke bottles and went to the guidance counselor. I showed her everything, and she confirmed that it was indeed alcohol inside the coke bottle. I sent the videos to her and she kept the coke bottle.

The next day, he wasn't in school and there was a substitute. The vice principal came down to our classroom and questioned my entire class, and they all confirmed what I had said to the guidance counselor. After the period was over, he informed us that he had been fired on the spot. Not only that, but his teaching license was revoked, and his wife was filing for divorce for separate reasons. (I don't even know how he managed to get married in the first place.)

She told me this story one time when we were driving home from WalMart. I was in high school at the time, but she told me this story on how she dealt with bullying when she was younger. She told me this story as I have been brutally bullied throughout msot of my time in grade and high school. I want to preface this pro revenge is a little different from your usual as my mother took a direct approach to handling a bully. 

So this was when she was in the third grade and the boy that picked on her was in the same grade as her but bigger than her. At the time, my mother was called Blue by the other kids as she always wore a Blue dress or something Blue with her outfits. She is still called this to this day by her friends from that time. (yes her friends in grade school are still her friends now with kids of their own.). This was roughly during late to early 70s. So this is a throwback. 

My mother had a bully by the name of Raymond.(Not his real name.) That would bully her every day and make fun of my mother nonstop with teasing and name calling. He also made fun of her home situation.(She was one of 9 kids). This reach a boiling point one day during spring time when he purposely tripped my mother and expose her undergarments for the rest of the class to see. This was very embarrassing and my mother went home to tell her mother what happened.(Her mother being my grand mother by the way.). She was crying.   


Basically she told her mother what happened and told her if he tries anything again she permission to beat him up. The next day at school, he slaps my mother up the side of the head. She slaps him back in the face and balls up a fist saying, ""Me and you 3:30 outside of the school. We're going to settle this.""   


Yeah, I know this is very old school. Usually kids these days will try and jump a kid when they're not looking. But this is back in the days, so things were different. Anyway, at 3:30 went down both met up with their friends serving as witness. They start to fight and it is a pretty even match as both my mother and Raymond brawl from outside of their grade school to a few blocks near her house. It was back and forth but my mom was holding her odd. They got close to a nearby vacant house and Raymond tries to tackle my mother into the wall. My mother goes low and tosses him over her head into the window. It breaks on impact and the kids lose their minds at what they just witnessed. They all book it as my mother just walks home with her friend after that with a bloody lip. Word spread fast around the school that, ""Blue toss Raymond through the window!"" My mother gained a lot respect among her peers for that and the Raymond left her alone after that. Years later he still brings it up with my mother telling her that was a wake up call for him to stop acting bad. No cops were called as my mom's mom talked to Raymond's mother about what was going on. She let it slide as Raymond didn't suffer bad injuries from being toss into a window and learned his lesson not to bully girls.   


I was jsut blown away by this story and got it confirmed from her other friends at the time and Raymond, the bully, himself. Man things were very different back then.

Afterwards he was impolite, pushed the responsibility to another department, offerred no help at all, and dismissed my case by giving me their corporate customet service number that was a hassle to get through.

Next week, I'm going to go to his office again with some imaginary problem inquiry, with my real goal is getting his full name and maybe a business card if possible. A quick search on google should give me all the info I need. I'm going to curse him.

Since he plays around with customers, I'm going to play around as well. Plus it's mostly just superstitions so if something bad does happen to him, it's likely unrelated to me, but I get to laugh about it.

I reached out numerous times, but never with a lawyer, and they always promised to remove my photos and to ensure it didn't happen again. This has been going on for about 6 months.

Looking through my photos and the photos on their page, I realized they're using an algorithm or program of some sort to automatically download Instagram photos with a specific combination of hashtags, and to automatically post them on their Facebook page (without credit, if that's relevant). Over the weekend I had the idea to use a bunch of bogus Instagram accounts over the course of a couple days to upload a large number of softcore and hardcore pornography pics to Instagram, with the specific combination of hashtags. Most got removed almost immediately by Instagram, but at least 10 of these pictures were picked up by their program and uploaded to their Facebook page.

I've since been messaged by the company on my Instagram (I assume they're assuming I had something to do with it since I've been regularly sending them takedown letters), threatening to sue me for loss of revenue, the spreading of lewd material, and the sabotage of a business.

It's sat on about an acre to 2 acres of land with some impressive cast iron fencing all the way around. Think the Rosewood Manor (fictional mansion from a horror made-for-tv movie) on a smaller scale. 

Fast forward to when I was 17, by this point my friends knew that this would be the place to find me if they couldn't locate me anywhere else in town. I heard a car coming up the long drive to the property and didn't even bother turning around as I just assumed it was one of my friends. turns out it wasn't one of them. It was the little old man who owns the property

I won't go into details about what I said before realizing it wasn't someone I knew. But let's just say the old guy got a pretty good kick out of how sheepish I became after calling him a few expletives in a rather friendly manner. 

So after a couple minutes of conversation telling him how much I admire the place he invites me inside to help him with some of the yearly chores he does around the property. 

Skipping ahead to when I'm 23, by this point I had already been the one doing the majority of the upkeep on the place on a monthly basis and was eventually told that if I wanted the house and property it was mine. 

Excited Screaming. 

That same day we had the paperwork drafted up and notarized and I began to move in.

It was like a fantasy come true. I had the home of my dreams and a lovely location. 

Now, skip ahead again to when I'm 28. The old man has died and I am sent reeling from it. About three weeks after the funeral I wake up to cows filling my property and an eviction notice, handwritten and stapled to the front door. 

It was the grandson of the old guy claiming that the property was now his and I had two weeks to get the hell out. Oh, hell no.

I call the phone number at the bottom of the eviction notice and ask what all this is about. In not-so-nice of terms, he told me that the property was rightfully his by the original will drafted up by his great-great-grandfather being the only living blood heir to the land so I wasn't welcome anymore. 

I informed him that his grandfather had given the property to me, and I even have paperwork to prove it. He hangs up. No further contact via phone or text or anything though I tried. 

During the next two weeks I had Windows broken, property destroyed, the fence damaged almost to the point of beyond repair, windows busted out.

Last summer, my friend caught his now ex-wife cheating. 

We all lived in an apartment complex and knew each other well. My friend (26) is a really good manager at a retail store and makes enough to pay the bills and still have money leftover. The Wife (27) works an admin job. They've been together for 6 years, married for 2.

His wife, while secretive, seemed like a very kind woman. She apparently met a guy online, got her girl-boner going, and set up a fuck session at a hotel.

It happened with the some ""I'm going to dinner with the girls"" excuse and my friend's intuition kicked in that something was wrong.

So, he calls me over and asks what he should do. Me thinking this was no big deal, I tell him to just snoop through her social media if it's bugging him that much. He does, and FB wasn't holding back. The messages I read would tear me apart but my friend kept his composure, screen-capped as much as he could and asks if we can go to their hotel.

I grab my cousin because I had a feeling things might get physical and we drive 30 minutes to the hotel. He gets out, tells us to follow him and we get to the lobby.

My friend walks up to the guy at the front desk and tells him the whole truth. There were better ways to do it but the truth was enough for the front desk to call up the room with the wife and ask her to come down and clear up any misconception.

When she comes down the elevator, she sees us and stops like a deer caught in the headlights. Casually walking up to us and trying to play it off with the ""it's not what it looks like"". 

He falls to his knees and starts sobbing and begging her to ""come back"", ""what did I do wrong"". In front of everyone. In the lobby. Where everyone was staring.

I'm thinking this is real, so I tried pulling him away from her while saying: ""She's not even worth it, you can do better than her."" I'm flustered because this was my first time experiencing something like this and I was basically doing what I thought was right at the time.

Everyone was staring us all down by the time we manage to drag him away. She obviously tried following us, apologizing and other BS until my cousin had enough. He snaps and yells at her, yelling: ""Haven't you hurt him enough?"" (Paraphrasing but it had enough of an effect to make the Wife go ""oh shit"" and cry.)

We drive back to the complex and I set him up in my apartment. My mom was cool with it and gave him the couch. (She works nights so she's cool with anything as long as I don't make too much noise.)

Almost an hour later, his in-laws show up trying to figure out why their daughter is freaking out. He sits them down on our dinner table and tells them EVERYTHING and even showed them the screen-caps of her bad-mouthing him.

They were obviously mortified and quietly left after some time. Later on, I discovered that they disowned her. (I learned that the in-laws had both dealt with a cheating ex in the past. Yikes.)

He asks if we can play videogames to keep him distracted. We do, and play 2k.

His Wife eventually shows up, banging on the door, sobbing, and begging for forgiveness. He didn't want to open it but she was creating such a scene that the neighbors came out to figure out what's going on.

They get her side of the story and come up to our door and ask us what's going on. She tells them more BS about how she's being misunderstood (lol). My friend didn't say anything, just sent them screen-caps before locking himself in the bathroom. 

My mom, pissed off, kicks everyone out except me and my friend who was still in the bathroom.

He stayed for the weekend, and Sunday was dead quiet. Monday comes around, and Wife tries talking to him again. This time however, he invites her in but my friend was cold and straight to the point. He wants an amicable divorce. She, obviously, was devastated. 

His reasoning was that he trusted her with everything and she burned it all away. Nothing can rekindle their relationship and it hurts just looking at her.

I don't know how he managed it but he pulls it off without a hitch.

Everything gets processed, and trying to maintain the good guy image, he helps her move all her stuff to a storage unit, and pays for a month's rent at a motel and they go their seperate ways.

Now that everything was over, he calls me back to his almost empty apartment and tells me the truth. He already knew that she was cheating and wanted everyone to hate her before getting the divorce. I don't know if all of it was an act because he was crying for a while but he did have a malicious intent to ruin in some kind of way.

Well, he got exactly what he wanted. I felt a little betrayed but he owed up to it, apologized, and bought me and my mom a cake for our birthdays. So now we're cool and mom enjoys having him around on her days off.

Right now, he's with another woman he met a couple months later that seems pretty chill and funny. They've only been together for at least 5 months and they've been doing everything together and seem very happy. (She actually came to me one time and asked me to help surprise him. Something the other one never did.)

So here's hoping he'll be in a well-deserved happy relationship!

Oh, and to add a little salt in the wounds, he tells me that if he ever gets engaged to her, he plans on telling everyone that the divorce was the best thing to have ever happen to him.

I'm posting this because, while I don't feel sorry for the ex-wife, I think he might be going a bit too far. I've never been with someone as long as he has so maybe it is justified but I want to hear what everyone else thinks.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,920683,public,self,My friend destroys his cheating wife's life.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/ezdonk/my_friend_destroys_his_cheating_wifes_life/,no_ads,0.0,,,

My family and I emigrated to the US when I was 7, and for the first 3 months we were here we lived with a relative of my mom’s who emigrated a few years before us. The dad helped my dad going to interviews, walked him buying a car and helped us find our bearings in the US.

My family and I are Buddhist and this family are solidly Fundamentalist Christians. While we lived with them, they strongly encouraged us to go to church with them every Sunday and when they tried to keep us going to church with them. when my family found a temple and started attending that temple, they started treating us like shit.

Their sons would pick on me and make fun of my English and told me I won’t go to college and probably just end up being a repair man. The mom and their daughter would make fun of my sister for her rapid weight loss and gains. When we found out later this was due to lupus and she had to be hospitalized, they told my mom that the reason my sister is sick is because we worship “demons”.

About 15 years ago, the dad lost his job. My parents who were now doing well, needed to re-tile the house, hired the dad to do it and when I asked how much they were charged I was floored thinking they miscalculated, I told them they were overpaying but my dad just said, we’re paying them back.

This happened again, every home improvement project my dad did, he would always hire the dad and would always be overcharged. The shitty thing is, the work was beyond sub-par, like the re-tiling work, I had to re grout the entire job when I visited one holiday. On top of this they would always ask to borrow money and never paid my dad back.

At this point I figured my parents paid them back and then some. Frankly I was completely done with them when I heard what they said about my sister. One day, I get a wedding invitation, their middle son is getting married. Not wanting to have anything to do with them, I RSVP no. about a month later I got a call from their mom asking why I haven’t sent a gift yet.

She demanded i sent a gift despite my protest I am not obligated to, then she mentioned how my family owed them and she knew I can afford to send gifts because I had a well paying job and how she always prayed for us to be saved. When she said this it trigger the wheels in my brain to turn and I told her, she's right I was being rude I will send a gift.

When I hung up I immediately looked up every Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Jain, Sikh, Zoroastrian houses of worship in their area and made a donation in the happy couple’s name. Then I also donated to the Satanic Temple and bought the ENTIRE FAMILY membership cards and certificates to the Satanic temple.

About 2/3 weeks later I got a call again from the mom, I answered as politely as I can ""Oh Hi did you enjoy the gift?"" This was met with a barrage of yelling, screeching and a torrent of insult. I was barely able to make anything out.

The daughter called my sister and the middle son called me later demanding an explanation I flat out told him everything and was 100% non-apologetic about it, actually I did say I was sorry for not being there to see the whole thing go down.

When I spoke to my sister later, this is what we’re able to piece together. They had the wedding shower at their church after services. And they were opening their gifts then. Well they got to my gift; everyone was uncomfortable seeing all the donations to the houses of worship with definitely non-Christian names made in the couple’s names. Then the bride’s parents flipped out when they saw the membership cards and certificate with the family’s name on it and they freaked out even more when they saw the Bride’s membership card.

They bride’s parents demanded she break off the engagement and she did. Every one in their church apparently thinks the whole family are Satanist trying to corrupt their church, and they are treated as pariahs in their church. Now people are telling them they’re going to hell. I ran into the mom and dad a few weeks ago at the market and I look at them raised the Satan hand gesture (Index finger and pinky extended, middle and ring finger tucked and thumb folder over them). They scurried away from me.

Was I an asshole for doing it, yeah no debate there, but I figure, with how much I donated, I don’t think anyone can call me ungrateful, or say it’s a cheap wedding gift.

About 10 years ago I started college out of state, I lived in the “party dorms” of a relatively large state school and as a consequence was dragged to sorority recruitment by my friend group from my floor. I didn’t wanna go, had no interest in Greek life past using frats for free alcohol, but my neighbor paid my registration fee and told me she’d smoke me out after just so we could all go together. Turns out I found a sorority I fit in really well with, the girls were not typical blonde blue eyed ditzy southern belles w fake pearl necklaces from michaels- there were more girls in the agriculture school than in communications or business and most of them could out drink and smoke anyone. I loved it, ended up drifting away from my freshmen group and diving head first into Greek life- both in regards to leadership positions and parties. Every night of the week I was at a different frat, my favorite one was our direct neighbors. There I met the man that would ruin my life. 6’4” and over 300lbs he was hard to miss, and his personality filled the room. Everyone loved him, he hated me. Don’t know what I did but he refused to speak to me or even look in my direction for months. 

One day he just switched it up and decided to befriend me. I won’t lie, in college I got on well with the guys Bc I was pretty and loved to party but I don’t think I was stuck up, so I was confused Bc I had never really encountered anyone that didn’t like me instantly up until that point. Yes I know how annoying this sounds now. 

By the end of my freshmen year were dating- and I mean I’m spending every night at his house and cooking him food type of dating. I did everything for him. I don’t know why. Over summer break I drove the four hours to his subleased apartment in a different city just because he told me to. He told me he loved me, and I believed him. Over the course of my time in the Greek system I began drinking- a lot- and abusing Xanax- a lot. Around my sophomore year I realized it was a problem and stopped pills of my own volition and tapered my alcohol consumption. However I noticed that even though I was drinking less I was still blacking out and waking up with bruises I didn’t remember the origins of. It wasn’t until the end of my 3rd year that I realized what was happening. 

My boyfriend at the time and I were constructively living together. At parties I rarely left his side. I went to his classes. It wasn’t that I wanted to be with him but I had nobody else to hang out with- at least nobody meaningful. All my connections were strictly surface level as my bf would cut people off who would voice how weirdly demanding he was and how co-dependent I was. At some point he asked if we could try rougher sex. I initially said yes but immediately implemented our safe word when he started choking me. A week or so later I woke up after a party I knew I had only had three beers at with no recollection, in my boyfriends bed completely naked and bruises all around my neck. I don’t know why I was so sure with so little evidence but I’ve never been so certain of anything else in my life than the fact that my boyfriend had been periodically drugging and raping me for god knows how long. 

I couldn’t confront him immediately and risk being manipulated into letting him continue so I devised a plan. That next weekend I watched my drink like a hawk, purposely setting it down next to my boyfriend and keeping an unopened beer in my hoodie pocket for when I got back. I switched the two drinks out and did my best impression of a wasted sorority girl. I heard my boyfriend fake complain to his friends about how he had to take me home *again*, them joke around in a way that confirmed this was typical and him cart me off into his bedroom at a quieter house down the road. Starfished on his bed, I laid there in terrified silence while he methodically stripped me naked and flipped me around to a position I never ever consented to while sober. After he slapped me a few times and started setting up to rape me I had enough evidence. At that point I did something I’m not proud of to stop him. I tried to force myself to pee the bed, the pressure also made me shit myself. It took everything in me to not burst out laughing when he realized what happened and started cursing me and flipping out, especially considering he had to clean everything up because he was under the impression he had drugged me into a comatose state. 

I woke up in the bathtub and groggily asked him what happened, I played the remorseful and dutiful girlfriend. I washed his sheets and replaced his mattress cover all while planning my long term revenge. He collected very expensive hand blown worked bongs. They were anywhere from $300 for a bubbler to over a thousand for a larger bong. The glass art on them is what made them unique. They were also very fragile. The next time I was alone I set about making small cracks in the pieces that would either eventually break through normal wear and tear and render the pieces unsmokeable or worthless- about 6k worth of damage. Then I went into every account I could think of and changed the passwords. I poked holes in all of his air sealed weed storage bags and jars, I went through his vinyl collection and put records in different sleeves with no sense or reason (about 200 records). After my petty side was satisfied I went about ruining his personal and professional life. I sent lewd emails to his fraternity headquarters from his school email that eventually got him kicked out. I called in an anonymous tip to his employer (a finance internship) that got his entire team of interns drug tested- which he failed and lost the promise of post graduate employment with them. I supported him through all this as much as I could (emotionally, I didn’t let him touch me anymore.) eventually I told him that he repulsed me and I was breaking up with him because of his body. I didn’t mind the way he looked, I just knew it would hurt the most. 

I’m not proud of the way I broke up with him but short of slitting his throat, it was the most painful way I could think of breaking him. Last I heard he had gained 100lbs and hasn’t had a gf or made use of his diploma in the 6 years since we broke up. I’m happily married and own my own business making over six figures. He calls me periodically and leaves messages telling me i’m the best thing he’s ever had and he wishes he could go back to the times we spent together.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,920891,public,self,"Date rape me and reap what you sow, it’ll be the last happiness you feel",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/ezhcqc/date_rape_me_and_reap_what_you_sow_itll_be_the/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I guess this is more my mom’s story than mine, but I was involved. It’s about how I got my sister. I’ll call myself Sara and my friend Alex.





Since middle school, I have been best friends with Alex. It all started with us being paired for a project, and we did great together! I struggled often in school, so my parents were so happy. So I invited her to eat lunch with my group of misfit friends. She was an outcast, too. From then on, she would help me with any schoolwork I needed, and I would help her with math. See, I wasn’t born in America, and my family immigrated during a critical period in my language development, so I needed anything and everything I wrote for classes proofread and edited. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased we moved for my mom’s career- she became basically Dr. Cuddy to our small town hospital and clinic- but that sort of move isn’t all roses.






Alex was great at improving my written work. Even my parents loved her, because they saw my grades go up as she helped me, and she was always respectful and quiet. A Good Influence.






We quickly became best friends, so much so that everyone at school tended to refer to us in one breath as “AlexandSara.” The only classes we ever had differently were AP English for her, regular for me, and our language classes. She took one and I took the other.






I still feel bad about not figuring out what was going on earlier. But Alex was the brainy one, not necessarily me. Sure, there were hints. I’m pretty sure it’s not normal for your friend to eat half your kitchen when she comes over, or my having to sneak her breakfast and other extras. But I just thought it was a weight thing. Alex’s mom was a rail thin athlete, who also thought it was important for her kids to be bilingual. It’s hard to know what’s going on when you don’t even know a dozen words of said difficult foreign language. And we hardly ever went to Alex’s house anyway.






Over a period of the first three years I knew her, Alex slowly changed. It was nearly unnoticeable unless you knew her as well as I did, but she went from talkative and happy to withdrawn and...crushed. I don’t know how else to describe it. It was like cutting off oxygen to a fire. Her flame suffocated. She didn’t want to go swimming or play sports any more, wore jeans and long sleeves no matter the weather, and seemed perpetually exhausted. Toward the end, I swear she was losing weight, and was as white as notebook paper. Another funny thing was that she *never* cried.






I, I mean we, *tried*. But every time, Alex would insist everything was fine, no matter who or how asked her. Eventually I dropped the subject. I could tell she was getting annoyed with me.





One late winter day, it was weirdly warm. It’s cold where we lived then, so of course we went for a walk. The sunset bathed everything in red. We were out so long that it was nearly dark when we stumbled back.






Alex tripped or something. Partially melted ice is the worst, and it was right at the foot of the neighbors’ gravel driveway. Before I got there, she was already staggering to her feet again, so it can’t have been that bad.






“I just cleaned, so take off your shoes at- Alex, you’re bleeding,” my mom called, abruptly switching tack mid sentence, as we dragged mud inside.






“I’m okay. I just fell down in some gravel.” But one knee looked ruined, and there was a big scrape just above her elbow, already bleeding through the shirt.






“Let me-” mom insisted.






“*No!* I mean, no thank you.”






I caught a note of panic in Alex’s voice. Alex never panicked. Why now, over something so minor?






“Don’t be stupid. You might have some pieces of gravel embedded where you fell.” Alex flinched at the use of “stupid,” but she was four foot eleven and a hundred pounds if that at the time. No contest. My family’s unusually tall. It wasn’t hard for my mom and I to steer her, limping badly, into the kitchen.






I knew the routine from my mom treating a million childhood bumps and bruises, and went to get the massive first aid kit from the bathroom.







“Alex, hold still so I can-“ Then thirty seconds of the loudest silence I ever heard, just broken by the tap running, greeted me as I came back in.







“Sara, put it on the table. Alex, *breathe*. You’re panicking,” my mom finally said. Then I saw what made my friend finally lose her cool.







The parts of her arm not scraped raw were covered in a web of scars, some old, some fresh.







“Why didn’t you tell me?” I blurted out.







My mom told me sharply in our language to be quiet if I couldn’t help, told Alex it was okay, she wasn’t mad, we’ll discuss this after we finish patching you up. There were more scars on Alex’s legs, too.






Eventually, with lots of stopping and starting because she was crying so hard, we found out that Alex had been hurting herself for almost three years. She was always anxious. Everything had to be perfect for her mom. Even admitted, in a roundabout way, that said mom told her really cruel things, called her names, and didn’t like to give her enough to eat.






And of course, my mom had to tell her, hey, I’m going to tell whichever of your parents comes to pick you up tomorrow about this. So you can get help. “Better you than me. They’ll kill- I mean, be so angry then,” Alex, looking resigned, said.







I woke up to a raging argument the next morning. Couldn’t be my dad or brother- dad was abroad, brother already in college. No, this was a catfight. I went over to where Alex was sleeping and covered her ears. This was nasty. I recognized her mom’s voice. No, I won’t get her any help, she’s lying. Just being dramatic. Don’t listen to her. Don’t tell me how to parent.







Finally, my mom asked point-blank whether Alex’s mom would be pursuing any kind of treatment for her kid. Mommy Dearest said no, I get to choose medical care for my own kid, she’s only sixteen.






What happened next would have knocked me over if I hadn’t already been sitting down. I strained my ears and just caught, “...you’re right. It is your choice. But, I’m a mandated reporter due to my job, and you’ve just admitted you’re going to neglect your child’s serious medical problem. I put a tape recorder somewhere for this talk in case things got ugly. It would be a shame if someone reported you to CPS with evidence, you being a teacher and community figure…”







I jumped about eight feet in the air when Alex’s mom yelled back, “Are you *threatening* me?”







“Not at all, Mrs. X,” my mom said calmly. “What I’m saying is that if *you* don’t help Alex, *I* will. My family has grown to love her and we don’t want anything to happen. I have a form here that would allow me to make medical decisions for her, just temporarily. Sign it, leave her with us, and I won’t report you to CPS.”







There was more arguing, but my mom had clearly shifted the balance of power her way. I don’t know exactly how she did it, but she got the signature, and we kept Alex. I was so happy to finally, really get a sister, whatever the circumstances.







And Alex got better. It was really hard for her, but she made it in the end. After some time had passed, my parents, Alex’s parents, a mediator, and Alex’s stockbroker uncle all sat down together. See, Alex’s uncle had an education fund he was tending for her, and he was appalled to learn of his sister in law’s conduct.







By then, she was seventeen. It wasn’t too hard to pull the funds a year early and use them to pay for Alex’s portion of the family insurance premium, since they were furious about continuing to pay it. In return, her parents signed a temporary guardianship form. This extended my mom’s authority past medical decisions- it’s essentially the same form that lets host families of exchange students act as parents- into all major aspects, and let her sign forms as Alex’s guardian, so she could go on field trips again. There was even enough money, if she was careful, to put Alex through all of college and provide her with a small personal allowance until she graduated. Not that my parents couldn’t afford another person, but Alex was big on not being a burden.







My parents and I moved when I was 22, and even though it’s far away, Alex knows she can visit whenever she wants. Seeing her smiling and playing with my one year old son is really what made me think to write this story here. It’s not a perfect mean or funny revenge like many I see here. 






But my revenge is having my “sister” here. Alive. She still has some problems, and can’t work full time at the moment, but has a supportive spouse, a decent part time job, and volunteers at an animal rescue.

For reference: GF-girlfriend, GG-good guy, LS- Good guys little sister, LB- good guys little brother
So, obligatory not me, but a friend. He and his girlfriend had been dating since freshman year of high school. They were perfect together and there was nothing wrong with him, personality wise. He was loving and sweet, alwyas making sure his GF had what she needed/wanted. GF, on the other hand, refused to do anything for herself. For example, we had a test in Spanish class. The next day, we got them back and I got a perfect score. She asked me if she could copy it. She had taken her test home the day before so she could copy someones test the next day. We were all pretty sure she switched colleges and majors just so she could follow GG and copy his work.
Well, I recently found out from GG that GF had cheated on him with one of her exes, so he broke up with her. His family was devastated. LS down a week crying because she had gotten so close to GF. GF showed up at his house one night and drove off in their truck (both their names were on it amd they split the bill). He called her and told her to bring it back, or he was calling the cops. She brought the truck back and left. End of story, right?
Wrong. GF and her friend kept complaining to GG about not having the truck anymore. GF wanted the truck because 'its my truck and you have no right to keep it' and she needed it to go see her ex. GG, completely out of character, decided to give it to her. So he called GF and told her it would be at the closest gas station so she could come pick it up. He then got LS and LB and they destroyed the truck (slashed tires, ran the battery out, ran it out of gas, sugar in the gas tank, smashed the front and rear lights, ect.) GG then removed his name off the title of the truck, dropped it off at the gas station, and blocked GFs number. He told me, the way he figured, the cost of fixing the truck would be enough revenge for him because of all the money he spent on her.

TL;DR at the end

Sorry in advance for the spelling mistakes, English is not my first language but I will do my best.

For a little backstory, I am in an engineering school in France. The educational system is different than in other countries: to study engineering you don't go to university but you study in a private school. This is important because for the 3 first years of my studies, everyone studies the same subjects, pass the same exam, have the same project… etc. 

Also, the grading system is the following: grades ranging from 0 to 20 and you need 10/20 to pass.

&amp;#x200B;

The people involved in the story are the following:

* PP: Project Partner
* OF : Old Friend
* SA : Stupid Asshole
* Me… self-explanatory

&amp;#x200B;

**Here comes the story:** 

At the beginning of the second semester of my second year we get a small project in electronics. This project was fairly small comparing the time/work to the value it had on our final grade.

The task we were given was not hard but we have to work in VHDL, which we never used and never got any information on by the school: it’s the whole purpose of the project, to make us search by our self to learn how to use it. We had to work in pair so I decided to work with a friend in my class (PP): we were already worked together on project,  so we knew it will be alright. As in most informatic/ electronic project we have together, she hates to code and therefore is bad at it. So we agreed that I will to the code and technical stuff, and she will do the writing/presentation part.

We had couple hours in class to work on this project with a teacher. That guy had a reputation of being a prick, very severe when it comes to grading and not helping at all on the project. He was supposed to help us but didn’t do shit so everyone ended up struggling, losing time downloading the software needed, not having much information how to get started; we had lost most of our class time like this and were more or less alone to do it.

You should know is that my school has a VERY strict policy of not copying projects/not working with other groups, etc. Basically, we were told that if your code/delivery matched another code by more than 30% we would get a 0, basically sending you to the “retake” of the final exam as the project was so important it was impossible to catch up. The school has a very powerful bot to detect similarities with other projects.

After a difficult time to gather information online to get starting as VHDL is very weakly documented the project delivery date approached. I had done a pretty decent work and finished 2 days before the delivery. 

That’s where the trouble started...

It was my first year in this school as I changed school in between my 1st and 2nd year, retaking my second year. A friend of mine did exactly the same thing at the same moment: you guessed it, he is OF!

So OF and his project partner (SA) barely had a done anything on the project and were hoping on the generosity of a friend who could do the work for them. Little did they know no one wanted to give out their work to wankers like them as everyone was too afraid them copying too much and therefore get a 0/20.

As you would expect, OF went to me and I took pity of him (he is a good friend after all, I didn't want to be a prick) so I helped them to get started, not showing nor sharing my work, just giving them tips and website giving them instruction on what to do. SA came back to me couple of times to ask me things about the project. I didn’t think much of it I found him to be a nice guy so I often answered his questions. It’s important to know that I was still working on the project on my computer at the time to try to improve my code and prepare to present my work.

Fast forward to couple month after, me and my partner did great at the presentation and we finally got our grade for that project. And here, it was a mess for everyone… including us.

It took about 3 month to get it graded as the school didn’t realize when they gave us this project that you basically had only one way to do it right. The code being so short, about 80% of the students initially got struck for copying by the bot and would have had 0/20. In the end they only decided to give 6/20 to anyone who supposedly worked with another group. 

To my surprise I got a 6/20 and decide to go and see the school's teacher in charge to complain. (This is important) I guaranty them I work alone, I never shared my code with anyone and I don’t see why I have this grade. The teacher insists to know if I shared or copy my project which I reply again I had done nothing of that. I get out, after she told me she will see about it and contact the teacher who graded us.

The day after, I get an email from her telling me a group of student from a class I’m not in had a 98% match with my code. Only now I understand what happened. SA and OF must have stolen my project’s code somehow and I am in trouble because of it. From what I know right now, they either sneaked behind me to take photos of my code when I has working in a classroom (the code was hard but very short so almost everything could fit on the screen) or copied it when I got away from my computer (I play very regulary foosball so I take a lot of breaks there with friends) 

I go back to the administration to tell them I think I know what happened but I had no proof. She asks OF and SA to come but they naturally deny, telling I gave them my project and they didn’t steal it otherwise they would risk to be expelled from the school.

SA had stolen my project, told OF that I gave it to him and proceeded to delivery it without changing anything.  

My partner and I were furious, especially because our grade downed to 0/20 as it wasn’t considered working together anymore but giving project away. The administration didn’t like the fact that I lied to them telling I worked alone when to them I gave my project away.

&amp;#x200B;

**Time for the revenge!**

At this point, we were right after our final exams, I knew I would have to retake my final exam in elctronics to pass it and so will SA, OF and unfortunatly PP was dragged into this as well. 

I knew they almost never went to any lectures during the year so they barely had any notes from any subjects. They again, were planning on the generosity of some people to just hand them their notes.

Unfortunatly for them, I made sure for the previous weeks to spread my story as much as possible and so did my friends to destroy SA and OF’s reputation. I didn’t want to do much about it at first because I didn’t want to harm OF but my friends convinced me of doing my best to destroy them as they got me in trouble and I shouldn't let this slide. Luckily for me a lot of my close friends were in SA and OF’s class and convinced everyone to do not give them any notes. I knew at this point OF had 3 subjects to retake and SA had 4 and they would have to work a lot to pass their year: they only had about 10 days before the retake exams day.

The story spread in the school and at some point a lot of people knew about it, in the end no one helped them.

They both logically fail their year, lost 9000€ (10,000$) worth of a year in the school, lost their international exchange. 

OF left the school as he couldn’t afford more money in his studies and went to university.

SA is despised by a lot of people and has a bad reputation, he stayed in the school. 

I still feel bad for OF but he wasn’t working and would have failed either way.

I passed year passing all of my subjects so did my PP. But still got in trouble for lying to a member of the administration and to this day, they still don't believe me.

He was pretty cool but picky beyond belief and couldn't decide on what he wanted.

Finally though he ordered this ultra deluxe, 4 player arcade machine wrapped in Star wars graphics, I don't have the original pic so here's a sample render he spared no expense, spending $3000 plus $220 shipping.

The machine arrives in Melbourne 5 days later and he calls me up losing his shit. It's been damaged by the freight company. I send everything fully insured so I assured him it was ok, he's covered. Please send me the pics of the damage.

It was only very slight, nothing cosmetic, but the console was a little dislodged as they must have stacked something heavy on it.

I assured the customer it could be fixed, I'll contract a cabinet maker to come out to him and repair it at my expense, then I'll go through insurance later.

Nope. he didn't want that.

So i said ok, I'll arrange for collection and have it brought back to me, and I'll issue him a full refund including freight.

Nope. He didn't want that either.

Ok I said, what would make you happy then? It's something easy to fix, perhaps i can pay you what I'd pay the contractor (about $250) and you can fix it?

Nope. He wanted a full refund AND he wanted to keep the machine too.

I said that won't happen. Insurance won't allow it as the damage is tiny. It's like car insurance, they won't write off a whole car for minor damage that can be fixed.

He didn't care, he wanted a refund.

I said they won't do it, and I certainly wont pay out of pocket. Either I'll arrange collection of the unit at my expense and issue a refund to him or we have it repaired.

Nope. He paid via Paypal and he's putting through a dispute because the item ""didn't arrive as described"". I advised him that Paypal's rules also state that in order to get a refund, He'll need to show proof that he'd sent the item back or arranged with the sender to have it collected.

Nope. He's keeping it and getting a refund.

So I advised him that what he was committing was fraud and theft, Also Paypal will freeze the $3220 in my account and I'm not at fault here. That's what Paypal does you see. If anyone lodges a dispute, they automatically freeze the funds in the sellers account. it's guilty until proven innocent with them. It can also take up to 90 days to resolve, sometimes 6 months. I know, it's happened before.

He didn't care. The next thing i knew, I had a notification from Paypal. The funds were frozen pending the dispute.

The next step is stating your case to them. Providing evidence etc where they relay the info back and forth between the buyer and seller. Paypal ALWAYS sides with the buyer, sellers are a piece of shit as far as they're concerned. If it cant be resolved between buyer and seller, then you can opt to have Paypal decide. but their decision is absolute.

I provided my transcripts advising the customer that I'd collect the item and refund him, and he provided them with a fake pick up receipt. As far as they knew, he's done his part, now he's eligible. So they ruled in his favour.

So this fucker now has his money back and my $3000 machine. I was fuming, and he wouldn't answer my calls or emails. I'm a big guy and i had a rough upbringing in a tough neighbourhood, so i was about to jump into my truck, drive the 900km south, knock on his door and watch him shit himself as i repossess my machine. But my wife being the voice of reason calmed me down and said to try legal avenues first.

coincidentally he emails me 3 days later and says the computer in the machine stopped working. I replied ""which fucking planet do you live on where you steal an item then complain it doesn't work?"" he lol'ed me and said he had an IT guy.

A few days after that i get a call from a guy saying that his friend bought an item and the Hard drive is dead. It was his IT guy, and i don't think he knew the whole story. I asked him to find the serial number, it's just the date it was built and the iteration, for example 2312201901. He read the number out and i said ""oh it's in warranty, send it back and I'll send a fresh new one"" he bought it and sent it back.

Now note that he said the HDD was dead, that's a good thing. If it had been the computer, he could just use anything else and use the HDD as a back up. But since it was dead, and now i had his computer too, he has to buy a new system which would set him back at least $450 but he still couldn't play games in it. You can download the apps but there's a tonne of config work and button mapping etc. 

IT guy calls me a few days later asking for the computer, and I told him the story and that nope, he can go fuck himself. He also lol'ed and asked how hard it could possibly be to just download shit. 

See, what he didn't know is that i have a little fail safe built in. The encoder I use isnt mapped to the default keys on the apps. I changed everything around on the hardware to stop people trying to just clone it. It's not hard to get around, but most people aren't familiar with the nuances of emulators.

inevitably, i get another call a few days later from a different guy saying that he'd built his own machine but couldn't get it working. the symptoms were exactly that of trying to get my controls working on a different system. It was definitely the IT guy fishing. I played dumb and said i didn't know, sorry. Now this guy had an empty useless cabinet, so he left me a one star review on Google.

It's since been removed but it read something like ""poor quality build, flimsy, system doesn't work, do not buy from these people!""

I was about to jump into my truck again and drive down to that fuckface. But again, my wife is like a bucket of ice water to my fire. So i wrote a long letter to Paypal attaching all of my evidence of his fraud. Then i responded to the 1 star review with attachments to the emails and his admission to committing the fraud. Also i displayed his name and email address to smoke him out.

He immediately called and said, ""look, no hard feelings ok, but i received a damaged item and i'm entitled to compensation. Remove my details"" He was getting spammed relentlessly, but he seriously believed he did nothing wrong, I told him to go fuck himself and to enjoy his useless machine. I was still burning though.

I forgot about it after a few weeks, Paypal didn't respond so i cut my losses and moved on. But then something beautiful happened. It's as though the universe aligned and said ""Hey Abs, we're not going to shit on you today, here, take this gift on a silver platter""

I was on ebay looking for old non working machines i can buy and refurb, there's good money to be made doing that. A one day refurb could pull in over $1000 profit. He's listed my machine! but contrary to his google review, the description was ""marvelous hand built arcade cabinet, built by a master carpenter, flawless finish and quality, missing computer. Good for a DIY project"" (I'm not a carpenter by the way) he had it listed for $1100. That was still $1100 pure profit to him since he got it free.

I bought it under my wife's account and had it delivered to my home address. When i sent it, it was wrapped in about a 4 inch thick layer of bubble wrap. When it arrived it had a flimsy single layer less than 5mm thick. The courier who dropped it off was the same guy who picked up from me, we were good friends and he knew the story. So i said i was going to damage it, make it look serious, but nothing i cant fix in a few minutes. He agreed and said that he'd log the damage as due to insufficient packaging. Insurance won't cover it.

I knocked the panels out from inside so it looked like the machine had been crushed, realistically i only had to reset the screws and it was good as new, But it looked mangled.

Then i sent Melbourne dickhead the pics and complained about the damage. He said it was insured.

I advised him the courier said it was insufficiently packaged and that it's not covered, i want a refund, take this back. I knew he wouldn't take it back, it was totally useless to him.

He said he didn't want it and he'll refund the freight. I said nope. I can't do anything with a damaged machine, if he doesn't do anything, I'm filing a Paypal dispute under ""item not as described"" he wasn't happy, played the victim, played on my sympathy still not realizing who i was. Eventually after offering me partial refunds and getting rejected, he relented and told me to keep it and he'd refund me in full. He must've realized that his greed wasn't worth it and it cost him nothing.

So now i had my machine back and I was happy this was over with, still pissed at this guys audacity, but meh. That's not the end though....it gets better, oh does it get deliciously better.

Someone at Paypal business had finally read my complaint. Since I do a lot of work through Paypal under a business account, there's kind of a concierge service although not really, kind of like a priority service. They actually went through my complaint, verified that his pick up docket was actually a year old and unrelated, and read the transcripts of him intending to keep the machine and get a refund.

They refunded my money in full. Now i had my machine back and $3k of his money and he couldn't do shit because he got caught for fraud. Can't dispute shit if you got caught being dishonest

He called me up losing his shit. I laughed and said sorry mate, it's karma, It's purely up to my good will to refund you, go suck a doorknob.

He pleaded and begged, swore a lot, pleaded more, and I said i'll think about it. Legally he had no leg to stand on. But i have scruples. I donated it all to charity on his behalf. I sent him the receipt, he lost his shit some more, but now there were kids with food and clothes because of his douchebag-ness.

The cast:

Salty: Ya boi, sick as a dog, miserable and just wanting bed

SaltBae: The bae of salt, notoriously scent-sensitive

Karen: Self explanatory

It's early morning, maybe around 8:30 AM, and my gf and I are on the bus for uni. As mentioned, I'm sick as all hell, coughing, wheezing, the whole 9 yards. As we get on at a popular hub, we have someone sit in front of us, Karen. Karen had a professional look going on, clearly was someone important somewhere, and the moment she sat down she whipped out her makeup bag and was off   to the races.

As an aside, I don't get why anyone does ANYTHING hygiene or beauty related on public transit. The buses are jerkier than an epileptic at a rave, you get no privacy, and deep down you know every other person on the bus is halfheartedly watching you and judging your taste in lipstick tone. 

But I digress, Karen is working away diligently, until she pulls out a bottle of perfume to finish it up. Well shit. Saltbae is scent-sensitive, the last thing she needs is a dose of perfume administered less than 30 cm away right before her day starts. For Christs sake she's already putting up with Salty, let the poor woman at least have a peaceful bus ride.

So I gently tap on her shoulder, and politely request she not do that in such a confined space, especially near someone who's scent sensitive. She gives me a disgusted look, shakes her head, and goes ""not my problem"" and then hits that perfume button harder than Jong Un hit the nuclear buttons. Great. And wouldn't you know it, that famously jerky movement of the bus took that exact moment to hit the brakes, meaning she leaned forward, and the perfume missed entirely. Where did it go once it missed Karen's vapid crepe paper neck? Yeah. You guessed it. Right into SaltBae's face.

Well I'm mad now. That's for certain. Saltbae is now frantically rubbing her face with her shirt to get it off, and i know a long visit to the washroom to wash it out is warranted for her. Fortunately, none had gotten in her eyes, praise be to the glasses god.

All of a sudden, i can feel it. You know when you're sick and you feel ""it"". ""The big one"". The one that gets you scrambling for a tissue like your life depende on it, the one that makes you politely leave a room so as to not offend any women and children? Yeah. That. A hell of a sneeze. And the evil idea immediately takes form. This ain't going into a tissue my dear reader, no no. Karen had offended SaltBae. And that is unforgivable.

So, with all the aiming precision of Robin Hood at a corrupt nobleman, I sneezed, right into Karen's hair. Please skip the rest of this paragraph if you're squeamish, because godamn, it was gloriously gross. Like soupy green tar, with spittle mixed in, flecks of tiny bits of egg from my breakfast sandwich, hunks of booger, it was the greatest disgusting pile of phlegm to ever let fly, and it sprayed the entire back of Karen's head, in her hair.

Well Karen immediately flips out, and you can see the panic in her eyes and she wheels around and begins yelling at me, while the cogs grind in her puny mind. Does she try to brush it out? Does she let it continue to ferment and settle in? What in the hell to do? Makeup wipes? For a professional businesswoman like her, I imagine she's used to getting her way, not being bested by a man who looks like he requires a coroner more than a doctor at this point.

Either way, I took that opportunity to sweetly smile and say ""Not my problem."" God, her face was like a cherry tomato, so red I was legit worried she'd blow a gasket.

Luckily for me, my uni stop was right ahead, so shortly after SaltBae and I departed, leaving Karen with an oozing disaster in her hair, and a story in my repetoire for that time I became a bioweapon. 

Have a nice day Karen, glad your makeup is on fleek.

My names Brucie, well my fake name is, I prefer it over OP sometimes.. I'm from r/entitledparents with a story I experienced myself a few hours ago. Someone told me to post it here so here you go! Tldr at the bottom! 

So it's exam season and I'm in the ""extra care"" group. This group requires a bit of a boostie during an exam, and for me I require a laptop and a lone space. I have a few psychological issues and my hands are incredibly shakey constantly, so i use a laptop for all of my exams rather than hand writing it. I have been since Y9 and I'm currently in Y13.

One major issue with me is I can't think straight unless I talk out loud. I can do this in a hushed whisper, but it's why I have to be alone. I'm seated at the back of a large hall with my computer, far away from everyone else, so I can freely explain my thoughts to myself while tapping away.

Before I get on with the story I should explain Mr M. Mr M is a high end teacher with two students in this school, neither are important for this story. Mr M prioritises those students heavily and puts them in the best classes whenever he could, the classes I was in. They always got the top marks and were always winners in some sort of contest. I, being the quiet minded kid who focused much more on daydreaming about hulk fantasies, didn't care too much about these brats. I just kept on keeping on. Well until today.

I was in my history exam, quietly tapping away about stalinism and how Alexander II fucked everything up by trying to make it more modern. I was also whispering to myself as I did it, telling myself what to write it as I typed, but I felt something. A very sharp tap. I looked up to see Mr M glaring at me sharply. I didn't understand what I did wrong so went back to silently tapping, struggling much more as I'm still very anxious about my thinking issue.

Another hard tap. I turn back to him and he hisses some sort of noncense about me cheating. I remained silent. I would never cheat in an exam, even if I was struggling so bad. Why would he accuse me of it now? The silence persisted until he muttered something about ""having special treatment"" and ""his son requiring the laptop"". And before I could respond he had picked it up and begun walking away.

Now all of this was done in a very quick and quiet movement. I couldn't react, I just sat in stunned silence. My work was gone. I had been in this exam for an hour. I wanted to break down and cry, this was all too much for me. It was lucky Mrs D, the one who was in charge of the exams, quickly noticed my lack of computer.

Mrs D was the one who gave me the computer in the first place, so knew something was up. She told me to go with her as she took me outside, where I explained everything. The lack of computer, Mr M accusing me of cheating, being kicked out of the exam hall, EVERYTHING. She listened contently then told me to stay there and went off somewhere.

From what I got told from a teacher who heard the commotion, being near Mr Ms classroom, Mrs D had tore him a new one. She berated him for ruining my exam and stealing my property without any knowledge of my conditions. She eventually returned to me with the laptop and my memory drive, luckily he hadn't removed it, and gave me an extra time slip for 15 minutes. Luckily I was able to get that exam completed, even though it left me a bit shaken up.

This situation allowed other situations where students had failed or had work stolen due to this teacher, and it got to a point where they couldn't keep him on. So they fired him. And his kids? They got expelled. His licence was also removed for our country and will probably be the same for the rest.

If this doesn't fit here please tell me, I had it recommended that's all.

When I order the drinks I order the drinks in order of employment (mine, managers manager, manager (EI) guards (G)  and then minimum wage workers.) we don’t have many employees only 12 at the time. I order the managers managers drinks first. When I deliver her drinks she comes up to me and wails about how “You did not order MY drinks first so I’ll just have to order more and make YOU pay for the extra £50 (she already spent just under the limit)” so I said trying not to become unprofessional “ ok just call the owner to check if it’s ok”  she called the police saying “ I’ve got this skinny white boy threatening me “ then she called the owner(me)  blaring into the phone saying” I want to charge my minimum workers, especially this one who is harassing me” she blared that into the phone before looking at me the look on her face was priceless. I called the guard to keep her in place whilst I talked to the PO who had now arrived ( it’s a small town)  I said “ look on the cctv and you will see ( I began to smile broadly) . Apparently she was under warrant for arrest and had to pay a hefty £230,000 pound fine plus the £50 for the drink for multiple things. She did not have that money because although she was earning shy over 150k a year she spent it on useless things (expensive makeup, expensive clothes, expensive perfume those things) . I walked passed her and fired her and then she blew up. She elbowed me and said “assault, assault” she did this five times until the guard came and said “op has done nothing wrong so leave the premises now” she got escorted out. Her life crashed. 2 years after the incident I found her begging for money. I kinda felt sorry and hired her in minimum wage with close supervision of the same guard.

A huge part of my responsibilities was to ensure that enough funding could be allocated to both clubs and external organizations throughout the year.

An organization had approached us requesting $6,000 for a ""Black Student Only"" graduation event... now my personal thoughts on this event aside, at our exec meeting I told her flat out that 1. The $6,000 was far above the $3,000 donation limit within our bylaws, and 2. We could not afford to donate that much, given the budget cuts we were facing from the college. Our executive team voted against this motion and it was defeated... until she brought it to our monthly board meeting.

Here in front of two school newspapers, she (the official spokesperson of the union) accused me and a colleague of being racist for citing our concerns against funding this event, ultimately bullying the board into passing this motion, and illegally providing funding for this event. (This is not the first time she'd pulled shit like this, constantly using the privilege card to get her way in meetings, and accusing us as ""colonizers on this land"" of not understanding the ""other viewpoints"" of the victims out there.)

This was ridiculous as  1. Both of us were brown dudes, who are most definitely NOT racist, and 2. Because of her actions, we would not be able to afford to fund a range of events such as our outdoor art festival, clubs week, etc.  

So I hatched my revenge. She had a low understanding of the bylaws and would constantly misquote them to suit her needs, so I took advantage of this to start the impeach process against her. With 15% of the students signing a petition for a referendum, we could trigger a vote to impeach her and get her out.  With a team of 20 students who all had a disdain for her, we got those signatures in a week.

Furthermore, as the signing officer for the union, I had the authority to contact our lawyers and communicate with them about questions or concerns I had with financing/bylaws... to which I asked if what she did was legally allowed? The answer I got in writing was no, that is considered slander, could pursue punitive damages for that if I chose. 

It's now a week after she pulled her bullshit racecard, and I had the happiest moment of my career in that union. I handed her the petition with 2500 signatures and told her that I was triggering a referendum against her to impeach her as ""you are not fit to be a leader. You lie, you take advantage of people in the office, and contribute nothing"".

Her face was a mix of rage and confusion - kinda unsure of how I did this since she thought I was this dumb little boy who was going to let her walk all over me. WRONG.  I let her know that per our bylaws the referendum was to happen within 14 days so she may resign before then or we will do this with the whole school watching. I was about to give her the letter too when she started to yell at me telling me ""YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT"" , ""I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR BREAKING YOUR OWN BYLAWS"", etc. - I just noped tf outta there. If she wants to do this public, so be it.

I was anxious as shit for the next two weeks (did not want to work in my office with her), but come the day of the referendum I was a buzz with excitement... the format was an emergency general meeting where cases were pleaded and a vote took place with members raising their hands to cast yes or no.

The auditorium we chose was PACKED. 800 kids in the room, many carrying a proxy card to vote on behalf of up to 10 students.

She pled her case stating that as a woman, she was being unfairly targeted as a leader who was only ""standing up for marginalized communities"" and that us VP's were doing this because we didn't like her as a person (which to be fair at this point WE DID NOT, but that's unrelated).

I went up to the mic and started to spill all of the bylaws she's purposefully broken, and just poured out how toxic she'd made working in the office in my tenure. I had a signed affidavit from 10 members of our board confirming she abused her position as the official spokesperson of the union to slander my co-worker and me then pulled out the letter from the lawyer and put it onto a document magnifier to show the room that what she did was against the law and could result in punitive damages against the UNION. 

I told the students ""you know what type of leader she is, and you know what type of harm she'll bring if she continues in this role. I do not want to sue this union, because I care about the well being of you students, and cannot in good conscience bankrupt you all. Please vote knowing this and who really cares about the students.  Thank you"".

And like that, we motioned to a vote. With proxies, we had 1000 for impeachment and 200 against (mostly from her friend group). She finally fucking got rid of that smug look on her face and genuinely started to realize that people were NOT ON HER SIDE. I just smiled as the meeting came to adjourn and watched her leave.

The rest of the term was uneventful with a by-election taking place in the spring and a new President being appointed for 2 months before we were done. The best feeling was seeing her around campus, and her just me looks of loathing.  Shoulda known yer bylaws beach.

I gave him hope that we would get back together and he would have the dream life/future he always wanted but he needed to prove to me that he has changed.

Also, he was arrested in 2015 but I wanted to share the story.

My entire school career sucked. For a multitude of reasons but one of them was when I was a Freshman in high school I had a bully who was a fucking psycho. 

His name was Justin. 

When I was a freshman I was dating a Junior, so for whatever insecure high school reasons already most Junior guys didn’t like me. Justin was a Junior. So by this time he already had a well known reputation of being a physically violent psychopath. God knows how he stayed in school that long. There were stories of Justin doing this, hurting that person, saying this crazy thing etc. Shit like he said he wanted to join the army after school just so he could kill people legally. Honestly, he had all the makings of a school shooter that I’m un-sarcastically and truly surprised he never shot up the school. I’d like to think that nowadays school’s have a better handle on the warning signs and would take active steps to remove these type of people from the school before another avoidable tragedy happens.

Anyways,

I would see him in the halls and he was this tall guy with this crazy, dark, dead look in his eyes. You would feel super uneasy just seeing him. He was evil and you could feel it.

Where I come into the picture:

We shared the same lunch period. One day we were outside and I was wearing a shirt of a music group that had/has a cult following. At the time I was an avid and unapologetic member of that fan base. He comes up to me and says “Fuck {that band}!” My immediate response without thinking or hesitation was matter of factly “Fuck you.” 

Oh man.  

I believe we got into our first physical altercation then and there but I do remember for certain him following me inside after the period was over threatening and intimidating me. Since that point, I was on his shit list. He would seek me out and then jump me. He would threaten me and punch me. One time he called my house repeatedly (back when we had a landline) and scream and curse and threaten my mother to come and kill her and me. That time my mother actually called the police and an officer came to our home and both me and my mother made statements. As how it usually goes, he already had a criminal record and was already known by police. Nothing really came of it though.

I got so fed up of being physically terrified when being at school that I would actually bring a hatchet with me. At lunch I would take it out of my bag and put it in my pocket. I wanted to hurt him...but only to protect myself. I didn’t care anymore. I'm by nature not a physically violent person to others...but I was at my breaking point. Luckily, I never brandished or used it. After a handful of months of continual torment and abuse I guess he got bored, so he would only fuck with me if he happened to see me. A quarter through my sophomore year I ended up going to an out of state boarding school so that was the end of it. 

Until about 9 years later. 

I stayed in distant contact with the Junior girlfriend I had back when I was a Freshman...and she knew how Justin tormented me. She messages me on Facebook with just a link and says “the world is a safer place now. karma!”

Justin is a certified anti social violent psychopath, and those people don’t change. 

In 2015 at the age of 27 he was hunted and arrested by the US Marshall Fugitive Task Force division. Among the 34, ***I REPEAT 34-COUNT*** indictment, he raped and strangled two ex girlfriend’s, threatened one of the with a sledgehammer, shot and killed her dog in front of her and told her if she ever tells anyone he would do to her what he did to her dog.

**THAT** is my high school bully. I hope he rots in prison, and when he dies, rots in hell...where he belongs. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I just did a quick google search and I couldn't find anything on his sentence, but I have no doubt he's in prison for the rest of his life.

Company A did fencing/walls/barriers etc Company A was ran by Bob. Bob was a real upstanding guy, took over the business from his father and really grew it into something big.

Bob had an employee, Jake. Jake had been with Company A for quite a few years but Bob and Jake always rubbed off on each other in the wrong ways. Bob always felt like Jake was the king of shortcuts and shoddy workmanship.

When Bob took over the company from his dad, Bob applied more pressure on Jake to bring up the quality of his work or be let go. Eventually Jake got tired of the the increased pressure and quit and formed his own fencing company called Company B.

Here is where I come in, I started a job in a company providing business services to small to medium sized businesses in the area and both Company A and Company B became my clients.  This was several years after Company B had formed.

From my outside view point Company A was that local company that's been around forever that does good quality work that you can trust...but they aren't going cheap, they never try to be cheap, but you can trust them. Company B was the young start up who was cutting corners and being competitive in every way possible, often by lying, or misleading its customer.

Thats when company C comes in, Company C was a building a production facility in the area and wanted a wall with gates around its new production facility. This was going be a BIG contract and really the only two players in the area that could possibly do this job was Company A or company B. This contract was worth alot, if my memory serves me correctly the job was somewhere near 7 figures. 

Company A and Company B went to go bid. Company B came in at like a 30% lower price point and even though Bob tried to explain it wasn't possible for Company B to do the work that was promised at the price point that was given. Of course money talks and Company B got the contract. 

I remember Bob was furious, in his eyes he felt what Jake was doing was wrong, he didn't mind fair competition but Jakes MO has always been way underbid, over promise, rely on cost overuns to make a profit. Bobs opinion on business was a price is a price and if he says he's going X for Y he's going do X for Y even if he losses money. Its how he was raised.  

Some time goes by, and Bob gets a call from company C, they've apparently fired Jake and his company due to not being able to do the work required and ask Bob if he can come in and fix the mistakes. Bob agrees, and gets the job done. At this point Bob starts thinking, he's gotta take Jake out. Jake is taking too much money out of his pocket. 

Bob comes up with the idea of buying Jake out. But Bob knows if he approaches Jake regardless of what he offers to pay Jake is going say no. So Bob has got to be smart. Bob is talking to me about this doing one our meetings, we had become quite close. And I tell Bob ""I bet there are lawyers out there who specialize in helping other companies acquire other companies. Bob asks me if I know of any...I don't but I did have a client who specialized in business law who would be more familiar with this whole thing. I give Bob his contact info and Bob thanks me.

Bob contacts the lawyer and tells the lawyer what he would like to do. The lawyer tells Bob a lawyer who used to work for him now works for a firm that speacilizes in mergers and acquisitions and if Bob wanted to buy out Jakes company he's confident this firm could get it done. Also this firm was in the big city far away from their small community so its  unlikely Jake would know what's truly going on.

Bob contacts the firm and says he wants to buy out his competitor and would like to enlist their services. Now this is already getting a bit longer so I'll get to the point. This firm ended up buying Jakes company, lock, stock, and barrel and gave the company to Bob. All the while Jake was completely oblivious to the fact that his arch enemy has just acquired his very own company.

I recall Bob describing to me the day he walked into Jakes company with such delight. Bob was told he owned the company, Jake had been paid and was expecting to meet the new owner of the company that pleasant Monday morning. Jake was given the title of General Manager. And was considered 2nd in command now. 

So Bob walked into the building that once belonged to Jake with his documents and the lawyer that had helped him acquire the firm (Who Jake was familiar with) Bob walked into Jakes office to Jakes surprise

Jake: Hi Bob

Bob: Hi Jake, how are you?

Jake: I'm good, what are you doing here?

Bob: O nothing much, just thought I'd come check out my newly acquired business

Jake: Uh?

Bob: Jake, you sold your copmany to me

Jake: I did what? No I didn't! I sold it to XYZ

Bob: XYZ is the law firm I hired to organize the transaction I am now the owner.

Jake: That's bullshit

Bob: Here's the documents, (lawyer who Jake was familiar with confirmed this was all true)

Jake: So your now my boss?

Bob: yes, now get up, that's my chair and I'm tired I wanna sit down for a minute

Jake: This is my office

Bob: This is my company, and I have decided that this office is now my office so I'm going need you to get out of my chair

Jake gets out of chair

Bob: Great, well have a sit Jake

Jake: Thanks

Bob: Jake I think the first order of business today is getting rid of redundancies 

Jake: What do you mean?

Bob: Well you see Jake whenever a company acquires another company you get overlap, redundancies. Two HR departments, two sectaries, two accountants, etc. But now its all one company, so now you got redundancies, overlaps, which is quite frankly a waste of money.

Jake: Yea...

Bob: And I don't need two owners working for one company, (and he laughs and tells me he had the biggest shit eating grin on his face) Jake, its become apparent that your services are no longer required and effective immediately you are terminated.  

Jake: Protested

Bob: The decision is final, you may collect your personal belongings and leave the premises, what time did you get to work this morning?

Jake: 7 AM

Bob: Great, so you've been here for 2 hours, I'll make sure payroll pays you out for 2 hours on the agreed upon rate in the buy out agreement, have a nice day.

Jake: So your just firing me? Just like that?

Bob: Yup, should have done this long ago

Jake: what about my family?

Bob: Jake, I just bought your company from you and paid you a lot of money, you'll be fine. Now get out of my office and out of my building.

I pay for it up front because generally honor is a pretty big thing in Norway and stealing is very frowned upon, people usually follow up on the sending with no issue (although I’m not doing that again lol). 

Now If I ask for tracked shipping and pay for it, and the sender or the post office doesn’t have a receipt/documentation for sending it, it is their legal obligation to send back the money if it doesn’t arrive. 

So I try to contact him and he says it’s just a bit delayed. A few more weeks go by and nothing, and he stops answering my messages. I tell him about the legal stuff and he continues to ignore me. 

A week later I message his parents and gf on Facebook with screenshots of both the conversation and the transaction. He then messages me and says he’ll send me the money when he gets paid in 2 weeks. 

2 weeks go by and surprise, no payment and no response to my messages. I then contact about 10 people from his Instagram with the story and screenshots and saying he’s not responding to me.  Im not bothered to go through the police cause that would take forever. Im relying on the honor culture that he’ll be socially pressured into returning the money. He says he needs another 2 weeks to pay me back. I check his Facebook again and see that he just bought a brand new mountain bike for around $1000 which infuriated me. 

A woman responds saying she’d ask him about it via text. He says to her that he never got the money, so I sent a screen cap of the transaction and him saying he received the money and sent the package, so her and I caught him in a lie.

He then responds to my originally texts saying that he was gonna pay me back, but now that I have told people about it, he doesn’t want to. And he says it’s illegal for me to message his friends and takes the moral high road after scamming me for $600(fuck this guy! Right?), I read up on the laws and this kind of social pressuring isn’t illegal or punishable here.

He stops responding to me again, so now I message 30 people via his Facebook and Instagram to his family and friends. I get a lot of responses and a lot of people taking my side of this. He must’ve gotten bombarded with questions and messages, as he messages me an hour later saying he’ll pay me back, just get the messages to stop. 2 days later I finally get my money back a few months after the scam.

step MIL I will use D, and for my partner SO. TL;DR at the bottom.

A little back story. SO's dad has a thing for emotionally and sometimes physically abusive women (with the exception of SO's biological mom). SO's dad brought home D when SO was around 15yrs old. D could never hold down a job. Whenever she did get one, it wouldn't be long before it came to an end and it was always someone else's fault. She never finished university, again not her fault. 

She has also confided in me, my SO and his dad some off the wall stories that don't make any sense but she swears they happened. For example, she apparently dated a Guatemalan prince who convinced her to fly back to Guatemala where he kidnapped her and beat her as well as convinced all the airports to not let her fly back home to Canada.
She was often verbally abusive to my SO growing up, she would scream at him for no reasons such as ""petting the dog too hard."" I have many other examples of her craziness but I'll leave it at that.

Here is where it all started for me. It was 2017 and I was 19 at the time and I had driven to SO dad's house, SO was still living there at the time. We decided to leave to go back to my place. Side note, they live in the country and have a huge drive way. D always parked in the same spot and so did I when I visited. I was in the habit of not having anyone behind me when I put my car into reverse and took my foot off the break to roll out. I didn't noticed D's car behind me and I bumped into it. She was parked a meter *directly* (remember this) behind me.

D at the time was sitting inside the house watching TV, all windows and doors closed (it was May in Canada), when we left but she ran outside IMMEDIATELY after bumping her car. I barely got out of the car when she ran out. I apologize and when I checked my car there was absolutely no damage, I have a plastic bumper. Her car appeared to have the LEFT SIDE of the hood and frame dented inwards. This damage to her car was a lot more than I was expecting considering how lightly I bumped her car. so my first thought is to call my dad (I was living with my parents at the time.) I told her I was going to do so and she said not to worry about it and not tell my parents because they would never let me drive again. I knew my parents wouldn't be like that but I didn't want them to be frustrated with me and since my car was fine I thought it cant be that bad so I decided to put my phone away. She also said that she didn't want to call the police because she didn't want to have to deal with them. I felt awful at the time but also really confused, I started to have that gut feeling that something was wrong. Another side note, I'm a really quiet person who has anxiety so I can have a habit of letting people take advantage of that. 

She said, ""I'll just replace the hood, it will only cost 500$"" I should mention she was driving an old car that was 19 years old. I thought at the time that that sounds reasonable so I agreed. I'm a student at uni so I could only afford to give her 200$ up front and a few months down the road I gave her the other 300. 

In December SO and I decide to get our passports to potentially go on a trip together. I was visiting my SO D approaches and said ""You know you can't go around flaunting your passports when you owe people money"". I just stood there not saying a word because I didn't know what to say to that. She continues saying I owed her 700$ more. I told her that I dont understand, Its been months and that I thought I had already gave her what she had wanted.  My SO then rolls his eyes and walks away at that point. She the  starts ranting on about how awful it is to live with my SO and that I could do so much better. She actually said ""There's no such thing as a magic penis, you're just going to get tired of him. You have a lot of potential, you could do better.""  I was so shocked, I don't remember what I said but I remember I came up with an excuse to leave.

This is when I turn to my parents like I should have in the first place. My Dad says not to worry and that he will drive over to talk it out with them. My Dad comes home after an hour or so saying he had a beer with them and they decided that they will take their car to the garage to get an estimate and then my dad will take the car to his garage for an estimate. My dad is a stationary engineer and also knows everything about cars and had offered to fix it for free. They had agreed to show my dad the estimates within a week and also to not bother me about it anymore since I was trying to focus on school and this was giving me bad anxiety. They also said they were planning on scrapping the car and that I would only need to pay if they get the repairs done. I felt so annoyed that he even agreed to that since it's been several months since the incident but turns out this was part of a plan of his.

D eventually gets rid of her own car and SOs dad buys her jobless bum a new one. We find out it cost 2000$ She's been driving the old car up until this point.

Months go by, it is now June and my dad is sitting at home when the phone rings, it's SO's dad. He asked my dad for 2800$... not only has it been months since they last spoke, and a year since the incident, we also have never saw an estimate on paper. My dad laughs and just says no. D starts screaming, full on screaming. SO and I were sitting in the basement at his house so we could hear everything. She screams ""I TOLD YOU!!! I TOLD YOU!!!"" And more screams we dont understand and ""TAKE AWAY HER LICENSE!!"" The screaming lasts for around 5-10min. My Dad invites SO's Dad over for a beer so they could have an actual conversation about it with screaming but SO's dad declined.

That month there's a letter sitting on the table for me when I get home that my brother had picked up for me. It was from a paralegal, saying I had owed them 2800$ but, she was only going to ask for 1500$ since I already paid 500$. This letter not only had spelling mistakes but mathematical errors. We get a lawyer friend to send them a letter and we thought that was that. 

SO eventually moves in with me and my parents, because the emotional abuse from D became worse and was too much for him. She actually wouldnt let SO eat the food that SO's dad paid for. She would leave notes on everything saying ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH,"" and D and SO's dad would even have family dinner with his brother and grandma and not let him join while he was still living there. SOs dad ""tried"" to have him be allowed at the dinner table but D had SOs dad wrapped around her finger and could get him to do whatever she wants. The sad thing is that SO's dad was basically pleading for us to stay and cook and hangout but he didn't have the nerve to face his partner to ask her to stop. He would just say that D is just like that sometimes and ""I just really want everyone to get along and for us to be a family"" This is in August.

A year goes by, it is August again. I've moved out of town with SO. I get a message on Facebook from a different paralegal saying I've been served, asking for the same amount. I didn't even think that was legal in Canada but somehow this was court approved. The letter claims I ran OVER TOP the hood of her car with mine and that I agreed to pay for everything. Attached to this was an estimate from a mechanic, this was the first time I've seen any paperwork in 2 years! Not only that, the estimate was dated a year after the incident. There was a ton of mechanical damage that my dad says there's no way I would have been able to do that without damaging my car. My dad also points out, how did I damage the side of the car when she was parked directly behind me? I didn't even think of that. 

My Dad decides to represent me and he responds counter suing for the 500 I gave them since they had agreed that the money would be going to repair the car (he just did that to piss them off) and saying yes I hit the car but not to to the extent she's describing. Then we claimed what I had written above in a shorter way. My dad has lawyer friends look over our case and they laughed and said that my dad did a really good job writing everything up and that this case is so ridiculous we should be fine.

We go to our court settlement meeting and the first thing D accused me of was impaired driving. When it was my turn to speak my dad and I call her out on that right away and she says ""well, you said you were tired."" She also accused my dad coming over and being aggressive with them, referring to the time they had a beer together and that I'm the reason why they have a crappy relationship and so on. She said that I crashed into her car and it was in horrible condition and wasn't safe to drive. The judge calls her out on this saying that she drove it for months and that she drove it to a different city to go to the garage so it couldn't have been that bad. She also said that I went to Cuba, referring to the time my SO and I got our passport, saying thats why she is here today because if we can go to Cuba then we can afford to give them more money lol. We didn't even go to Cuba, not that this is relevant to the case. 
As she continues her voice gets louder and louder to the point that she's screeching at the judge. The judge says that she's beating a dead horse and that he feels like he's watching an episode of family feud. He told her the only way she would get anywhere is if she somehow could get the value of the car before I hit it. As you could guess we didn't settle on anything. 

A couple weeks later we get a letter for an offer to settle and we deny. 

My dad goes full investigation mode and finds the exact model of her car that was in top condition and its value is only 700$ he takes photos with a measuring tape showing that the damage doesn't even line up with my car. And we found that in the photos of her car that she took, there's rust around the damage so clearly she had already damaged the car way before hand. My dad also asked for her insurance info on the car because we had a feeling that she might be committing insurance fraud and they refused giving us anything saying she never contacted the insurance so there's nothing to show. 

Her paralegals continue to try to settle for an offer multiple times but we deny.

February 2019, the big day has arrived and we go to court. It didn't seem to start off so well because D had 2 paralegals and the judge told me my dad wasn't allowed to represent me because he didn't bring enough documentation. So with no notice, I had to represent myself. But the Judge did allow me to talk to my dad and ask him questions. D starts off saying that I was ""Tired impaired"" and that I had agreed to pay the 2000$ at least from the start. She said she didn't need to show me a written estimate because she could tell just by looking at it and I should have just taken her word and given her the money. She said the only reason why she got the estimate a year later was because we were ""demanding to see one."" (Sure D! Let me just give you 3000$ just because you asked) she said that I'm a grown women and could have called the cops if I wanted to, and that she ""needed to teach me a lesson that will hurt."" She then brings up that we went Cuba and spent about 4000$ on that trip and she deserved that money and that we should have given it to her instead.

Throughout the process the judge was being really kind towards me, giving me smiles of encouragement and even gave some small pointers of when I should say what. I just want to give her a shout out for being so supportive.

The whole time I'm interrogating D with my questions, she answers every question raising her voice pointing fingers at me, rolling her eyes and just genuinely being rude, just as I hoped for.

So let's here what the judge had to say. She says that D was ""being opportunistic, taking advantage of a new driver"" and that D ""is a grown women too who is also capable of making her own decisions and could have called the cops,"" She said that this should have never gone to court. The whole time D was sighing and throwing her hands up in the air. Then the Judge says, ""its easy for me to tell just by the attitude in this room today that you were bullying a 19 year old new driver into giving you money."" She also said it was ridiculous that D wanted to ""teach me a lesson"" 

D was the first to leave the room and as we exited... the look on D's face!! It looked like she was trying to kill us with her eyes. We all walk out with huge grins on our faces and as we walk by her we couldn't help but make loud jokes about taking a celebratory trip to Cuba. I swear she was about to say or do something to us the way she was staring at us, it looked like she wasn't even blinking, just a cold death glare but then both her paralegals got her attention and guided her away from us.

We celebrated with a lobster dinner that night.

Thanks Dad

Back in college, I served in the student union as their Vice-President of Finance. A huge part of my responsibilities was to ensure that enough funding could be allocated to both clubs and external organizations throughout the year.

An organization had approached us requesting $6,000 for a ""Black Student Only"" graduation event... now my personal thoughts on this event aside, at our exec meeting I told her flat out that 1. The $6,000 was far above the $3,000 donation limit within our bylaws, and 2. We could not afford to donate that much, given the budget cuts we were facing from the college. Our executive team voted against this motion and it was defeated... until she brought it to our monthly board meeting.

Here in front of two school newspapers, she (the president and official spokesperson of the union) accused me and a colleague of being racist for citing our concerns against funding this event, ultimately bullying the board into passing this motion, and illegally providing funding for this event. (This is not the first time she'd pulled shit like this, constantly using the privilege card to get her way in meetings, and accusing us as ""colonizers on this land"" of not understanding the ""other viewpoints"" of the victims out there.)

This was ridiculous as  1. Both of us were brown dudes, who are most definitely NOT racist, and 2. Because of her actions, we would not be able to afford to fund a range of events such as our outdoor art festival, clubs week, etc.  

So I hatched my revenge. She had a low understanding of the bylaws and would constantly misquote them to suit her needs, so I took advantage of this to start the impeach process against her. With 15% of the students signing a petition for a referendum, we could trigger a vote to impeach her and get her out.  With a team of 20 students who all had a disdain for her, we got those signatures in a week.

Furthermore, as the signing officer for the union, I had the authority to contact our lawyers and communicate with them about questions or concerns I had with financing/bylaws... to which I asked if what she did was legally allowed? The answer I got in writing was no, that is considered slander, could pursue punitive damages for that if I chose. 

It's now a week after she pulled her bullshit racecard, and I had the happiest moment of my career in that union. I handed her the petition with 2500 signatures and told her that I was triggering a referendum against her to impeach her as ""you are not fit to be a leader. You lie, you take advantage of people in the office, and contribute nothing"".

Her face was a mix of rage and confusion - kinda unsure of how I did this since she thought I was this dumb little boy who was going to let her walk all over me. WRONG.  I let her know that per our bylaws the referendum was to happen within 14 days so she may resign before then or we will do this with the whole school watching. I was about to give her the letter too when she started to yell at me telling me ""YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT"" , ""I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR BREAKING YOUR OWN BYLAWS"", etc. - I just noped tf outta there. If she wants to do this public, so be it.

I was anxious as shit for the next two weeks (did not want to work in my office with her), but come the day of the referendum I was a buzz with excitement... the format was an emergency general meeting where cases were pleaded and a vote took place with members raising their hands to cast yes or no.

The auditorium we chose was PACKED. 800 kids in the room, many carrying a proxy card to vote on behalf of up to 10 students.

She pled her case stating that as a woman, she was being unfairly targeted as a leader who was only ""standing up for marginalized communities"" and that us VP's were doing this because we didn't like her as a person (which to be fair at this point WE DID NOT, but that's unrelated).

I went up to the mic and started to spill all of the bylaws she's purposefully broken, and just poured out how toxic she'd made working in the office in my tenure. I had a signed affidavit from 10 members of our board confirming she abused her position as the official spokesperson of the union to slander my co-worker and me then pulled out the letter from the lawyer and put it onto a document magnifier to show the room that what she did was against the law and could result in punitive damages against the UNION. 

I told the students ""you know what type of leader she is, and you know what type of harm she'll bring if she continues in this role. I do not want to sue this union, because I care about the well being of you students, and cannot in good conscience bankrupt you all. Please vote knowing this and who really cares about the students.  Thank you"".

And like that, we motioned to a vote. With proxies, we had 1000 for impeachment and 200 against (mostly from her friend group). She finally fucking got rid of that smug look on her face and genuinely started to realize that people were NOT ON HER SIDE. I just smiled as the meeting came to adjourn and watched her leave.

The rest of the term was uneventful with a by-election taking place in the spring and a new President being appointed for 2 months before we were done. The best feeling was seeing her around campus, and her shooting me looks of loathing.  Shoulda known yer bylaws beach.

For some background, my sister has had issues carrying pregnancies to term after her first child. I don't know the full details why, but basically having her son messed her hormones up so badly that her body stops recognising the fetus as a fetus after a few weeks and dissolves it.

A few years ago, my sister was pregnant again, but this time she made it all the way to five months. All her other pregnancies barely got to 7 weeks, and the doctors hadn't seen any signs that this pregnancy was going wrong so we all got excited. Unfortunately, my sister suffered a miscarriage just after the six month mark because of the heart medication she was on that her doctor had failed to change or warn her would cause issue.

This story isn't about the doctor failing to warn or change the medication, but I know most of you will want to know if anything happened to him and it did. The hospital that helped my sister through the miscarriage (it was a dangerous one and could have killed her) wrote to the national health board and since the baby *would* have been viable if it was born, the doctor was fired and banned from practising medicine in the UK ever again for gross medical misconduct that caused the death of an infant.

Fast forward a couple of months and my sister built a small flower garden as a memorial to her daughter. She tends to this garden every single day, even when she feels like crap, and buried her wrist tag from the day she went to the hospital in it.

Now, my sister lived in a small block of apartments at the time, two stories tall and semi detached. Her upstairs neighbour was the *worst* kind of old man. He had his TV on max volume at all hours of the day, would throw chicken bones out the window into my sister's garden in the hope her dogs would eat them and *choke to death,* berated my nephew for playing in the *public* street, called my sister all kinds of names whenever they crossed paths and made one single death threat that he quickly rescinded when I told him I had a black belt in Aikedo and was fully prepared to break every bone in his body if he even *tried* it.

I am not a small woman, and am pretty muscular from said Aikedo, so he backed off.

Since the guy lived upstairs, his garden wasn't attached to the property like my sister's. It was a fenced off area just *behind* my sister's, and he never used it.

Well one day he was walking down the alleyway that led to his garden when he started ranting about their being cat shit in his garden. My sister also had cats, and they regularly went outside during the day. However, we lived in pretty built up area so there was literally *hundreds* of other homes with cats who could have shit in his garden. He decided it was *absolutely* my sister's cats though, and started to berate her through the gate. It was only about three feet high.

My sister is *not* somebody who backs down easy, often to her own detriment, so she argued back that he had no proof and that her cats hadn't even been *out* that day. When the neighbour continued to yell and insult, she told him that she was sick of his behaviour and that she was going to make *another* report to the housing association.

We'd made numerous ones, but in the UK getting somebody evicted is a lot harder than it rightly should be in these cases. We had *photographic evidence* of what he had been doing, but it hadn't been enough to get his kicked out, just slapped with warnings.

Well, once the neighbour realised he couldn't bully my sister, who is more petite than me, into just agreeing with him he decided to 'punish' her. My niece's garden was in a hanging basket on the gate to prevent any of the cats or dogs from digging it up, so the neighbour reached down and ripped all the plants out.

My sister was *horrified,* and just froze up. I was in the house, so I didn't see it go down but when my sister came in, white as a sheet, she told me what happened.

I immediately grabbed my phone, put it on record and walked up to the neighbour's door. Once he answered, I told him I was recording him for my own safety, was is law in the UK, and he said fine. I then told him he had damaged my sister's property and he could either agree to pay for the damages right here on record, or we would be taking him to court. I said this in as calm and polite a manner as I possible could while visibly shaking with rage.

He fucking *headbutted me.*

I don't know if you've ever been headbutted, but it bloody *hurts.* Your vision goes white for a second, and you're completely incapable of processing what just happened because your *brain* was just smashed against your own skull from the force of impact.

When my vision cleared, I saw the neighbour on the floor, knocked out cold. I stopped the recording and played it back to find that he had tried to *strangle* me after he headbutted me, and in my whited-out state I had instinctively punched him at *full strength.*

I posted a story on r/askreddit as little while ago about how I broke a bully's arm by punching it, and with Aikedo training I was stronger than ever. I hadn't hit him in the head, I'm pretty sure I would have *killed* him and I was in no state to aim that well, but I did hit him in the shoulder hard enough for him to bash his head against the door frame, which was what knocked him out.

I called the police, told them what happened and showed the the video of the neighbour attacking me to the officers who arrived on scene. I had a concussion and a nasty bruise, so they took both me and the neighbour to the hospital but the neighbour was cuffed to his bed and I was not.

During my time at the hospital, the police got a statement from my sister about the incident with my niece's garden. My sister wasted *no* time letting the police know of all the complaints and recordings of aggressive behaviour she had saved and sent to the housing association. The hospital kept me in for a week as I was still getting headaches even after the swelling and bruising went down, and by the time I got out not only was the neighbour *evicted* but he was facing prison time as well.

He only got a few months, but considering he was out of work, homeless, his kids (Who had come to pick up his stuff and got chatting with us) all hated him and he was not eligible for any benefits, he probably would have preferred to stay inside.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,921481,public,self,Destroy my Niece's memorial?

What I saw was the turn signal on a newer Audi.  It has a three way turn signal.  It lights up near the center of the car , then the middle of the turn signal and then the edge of the turn signal.  Very cool.  That reminded me of my old schoolmate, we'll call him Dave, because that's his name and Roxanne, aka Foxy Roxy.  

I went to high school with Dave and Roxy.  The year is 1971.  Dave's father owned a garage I think or something to do with cars.  Anyway Dave was kind of an electric tinkering genius.  He had an old car with two circular brake lights on the back.  A Corvair maybe?  At the time a Thunderbird or some other cool car had tail lights that did the center/middle/end turn signal thing.  Dave was handy enough to drill third holes for his brake lights and wire the thing up so it did the same thing.  Impressive as all get out back in 1971.  I knew Dave but not that closely.  Roxy was in one of my science classes.  She had a reputation back then and didn't really care.  During one of the labs she told me - For $15 you can have me for an hour.  I'll do anything you want, anything.  One hour- $15.  I turned her down - probably very awkwardly and never told a soul about it until today.  We didn't hang in the same circles and it was no big deal.  That was 11th grade.  In 12th grade around November rumors started flying around the school.  Dave had knocked up Roxy and both of them had dropped out or been kicked out of school.  Never saw either of them again during high school.  The summer after graduation I ran into Dave at a party.  He was alone.  I asked him how he was doing and he proceeded to tell me that he married Roxy, started working for his Dad and got an apartment.  He wasn't clear on what happened with the kid, miscarriage or died at birth.  Could have been an abortion but that was hush hush back then.  Both his and Roxy's families were Catholic but who knows.  Anyway shortly after Roxy started cheating on him and rubbing his nose in it and they had the marriage annulled.  Dave was angry at what Roxy had done to him.  He told me that he was going to go into business for himself. He was going to build and sell car alarms.  Back in 1972 that was not a very common thing but he knew cars and electronics and thought he could make a go of it.  I figured that he was nuts.  Who the heck needed a car alarm.  He bitched about Roxy cheating on him and how he was going to show her and so on.  Talk is cheap.  

Fast forward about 25 years.  Turns out Dave was way smarter than I gave him credit for.  He started one of the very first car alarm companies and eventually sold his company to some big conglomerate for several million dollars.  He retired in his early 40s - never married again. He came back to visit to our old hometown and looked up some of his buddies, one of which is a friend of mine.  Apparently they were drinking beer and shooting the shit and Dave asks if anyone knows what happened to Roxy.  He still resented her even 25 years later.  Roxy's life didn't go so hot.  She screwed around a lot and actually got arrested once for prostitution.  25 years later she was single, living in a trailer, working as a waitress and about 50 pounds heavier.  She looked far older than her years.  The guys told Dave that Roxy had two daughters shortly after she left Dave.  One had died of an OD a few years back and the other was working as a stripper. That should have been enough revenge for Dave but Roxy must have left some very bad memories.  Dave found out where Roxy's daughter was working and went to the club. Apparently the daughter was in her early 20s and looked a lot like Roxy did back in the day.  She wasn't actually a stripper but a bar girl that flirted with the guys and got them to buy overpriced drinks.  Dave played the ""out of town rich businessman looking for companionship"" card on her and she asked for $1500 for the night (prices had gone up considerably since her mother's day).  Dave negotiated it down to $1000 and they made the deal.  According to my friend Dave was very graphic in telling them how the daughter reminded him a lot of Roxy.  The next morning Dave asked her if he could get a selfie with her to show his friends that even at his age he could get a real hottie and gave her another $100 for a selfie of her french kissing him.  She had a rose tatooed on her wrist and it was apparently very clear in the photo he took. 

By then Dave was probably feeling like his revenge  was complete but he had one more thing on his agenda.  He found the place where Roxy worked and asked the greeter at the restaraunt if he could sit at one of Roxy's tables.  As luck would have it she was working that day.  According to my friend Roxy didn't even recognize Dave, he looked like a middle aged businessman and not a 17 year old hippy after all but Dave knew it was her.  He asked her - don't you remember me?  I sure remember you.  As it began to dawn on her who this guy was she getting a bit nervous.  Dave continues -""I met your daughter last night, she reminds me a lot of you and procedes to pull out his phone with the selfie displayed.  He leaves a $100 bill on the table and walks out, buys drinks for his friends that night and heads back to California never to be seen again as far as I know.

My friend swears this is true but who know, the guys back in my neighborhood did have a way of stretching the truth.  Heck of a story though.....

Story time:

So around 3 years (April 2017 I think), my aunt (Horrible Person) moved in with me. It’s important to know that HP is only 5 months older than me and was adopted by my grandparents when she was just a baby. Back when I lived in the same state as her, my family would often go over to my grandparents house to visit. HP and I basically grew up together and we’re treated like twins...up until around we were 8 years old and everyone quickly found out that we were as different as night and day. Needless to say, we didn’t really get along. 

A couple of years passed since I last saw her when all of this started. My family is military so we ended up moving across the country for 3 years. Towards the end of our last year, I found out that HP was gonna move in with us. My grandparents apparently had enough of her and were actually going to put her in foster care until my mom stepped in and said that we would take her in. My mom is a therapist and diagnosed HP with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and was willing to try and get her some help. 

When I heard the news, I was a little taken back. But my 15 year old innocent mind at the time tried to think that since we haven’t really seen each other since we were around 12, maybe we’ve matured enough to put aside our differences and get along. 

I was very wrong. 

The minute she moved in, my life became a living nightmare. She is in the same grade as me and instantly tried to start drama about me to my friend group and insisted that she needed to know every little detail about what was going on in my personal life because she’s “just trying to protect her little sister”. She would tell everyone EVERYTHING about me which really made me uncomfortable (I have a problem with being vulnerable). Not only that, but she would physically harm herself in front of me if she didn’t get her way. Every day my house was filled with her screaming and throwing tantrums over anything that she dislikes. 

July 2017, we moved to another state. Things only got worse. Being a military brat, I’m used to moving to new schools so fitting in and finding friends wasn’t that hard for me. HP, on the other hand, would rather try to steal my new friends away from me...even though none of them even shared the same classes. If I had a boyfriend, that guy would INSTANTLY become her new best friend. She would try and get close to my friends to find out more information about me only to use that information against me. School life was terrible. I tried everything I could to stay away from her. 

But home life wasn’t any better. I often found myself locked away in my room to try and avoid HP as much as possible. And, like stated before, she was always screaming and crying about anything and everything. She would even barge into my room (without knocking, might I add) at any time, either demanding to know something that’s none of her business or she wanted me to do something for her. She would even physically assaulted me if I told her to fuck off. 

I hated her. I still hate her. This went on for two years and every day I was more and more traumatized, regretting that I ever told my mom that I thought it was okay if she moved in.  

Finally, in the middle of junior year, I had enough. Something happened that made me have a major panic attack and instead of helping me, she instead opted to stand there and watch me cry, laughing and texting her friends about it. When I told my parents what happened, they sat us both down and told me to tell her what she has done to me and how that has effected me. I went on for at least 20 minutes, listing thing after thing and how I’m emotionally traumatized from everything she has put me through. And what was her response? 

“Well...you never tell me anything about yourself so I have to find things out through your friends. So what if you lose a couple on the way? We’re family so that’s all that matters.”

I lost my mind and my parents finally realized that she needed to go as soon as possible. 

“What’s the revenge” you are asking yourself?

It was my choice if she stayed or left. Of course I told her to leave. Oh but it gets worse. My parents told her that she needed to break up with her boyfriend. I don’t exactly remember why but what I do know is that apparently, HP never told her boyfriend that she. Has. HERPES. Lil FYI: that’s technically assault as I know they never used a condom. 

She was gone three days later. My parents took her phone (that they paid for) and sent her on a plane across the country. 

Where is she now? Well now she’s living in her strictly Christian parents junky apartment. She’s turning 19 in June and is MARRIED to a SIXTEEN year old boy. She and her now “husband” dropped out of high school and she contracted chlamydia. She’s been gone for over a year now and me and my family’s life instantly got 100x better. About a month ago she tried to get in contact with me but I just hung up the phone as soon as I heard her voice on the other line. No thank you. 

So in conclusion: Because she treated me and my family like absolute shit and I’m still traumatized from a lot of what she put me through, I put her right back into that shithole where she came from. I’m sure she instantly regretted everything but I couldn’t care less. She got what she deserved.

I used to deliver large cherry pickers to the building trade for a living. One day I was sent to a proving ground (a top secret test track where they test new vehicles away from prying eyes) to pick up a cherry picker that had been out on hire. 

I turn up in my truck late in the afternoon when most contractors have gone home only to find a different contractor using our machine. This happens a lot, contractors can't be bothered to hire their own or use ladders so they just grab any cherry picker they can find and use it. 

I shout up to these 2 guys who were on a ledge/canopy 50ft up the side of this newly built building, that they didn't hire the machine, shouldn't be using it and need to come down. 

They replied that they'll be done in half an hour and I'm going to have to wait. 

I tell them again that they need to come down now or I'll just take the machine wether they are up their or down here. 

One of the guys goes to the basket of the machine, hits the big red E-stop button (disabling the machine) and takes the key out. They both start laughing and mocking me that there's nothing I can do and I'm going to just have to wait for them to finish. 

At this point I'm pissed. If they'd have asked politely for 5 minutes so they could wrap up work I'd have waited but they said 30 minutes and were rude so I decided enough was enough. 

What they didn't know was that on this particular machine, even if you push the E-stop up in the basket, the controls at the base over rode it giving me control down on the ground. 

As soon as I went to the base controls they started laughing again saying that won't work because they hit the E-stop but their laughter stopped as soon as the cherry picker basket started lowering to the ground. 

They started pleading with me that they'd come down now and that they're finished but it was too late. I loaded the cherry picker onto my truck and gave them a big wave as I drove away. 

I rang my boss as I left telling him what had happened as a heads up in case he got an angry call. He sided with me and said he'd have done the same. 

5 mins later my boss calls me back and says one of the guys rang the number on the side of the truck and begged my boss to get me to turn around and come get them down. My boss declined.

We were a part of the same friend group for several years so it only felt natural that we started dating. He had enlisted in the marines and was going overseas in a few months but I was really into him and didn't mind a long distance relationship. Before he left, I took his virginity since he practically begged me to and dumped me a week later. I was extremely torn up about it and told our mutual friends about it. I expressed feeling used and manipulated and they all treated me like shit, saying he was a great guy and that I just wasn't good enough for him. They convinced me that I was the one who needed to apologize, so I did. My ex and I stayed Facebook friends and he was shipped off to Japan.

Not long after, I started dating a different guy who ended up being extremely abusive towards me for over two years. During that time, my ex would message me on Facebook frequently and tell me that he was in love with me and breaking up with me was the worst decision of his life. I rejected him multiple times but we remained friends. I was slowly becoming more depressed and suicidal because of the abuse from my boyfriend at the time. He frequently told me that I was worthless and that if I left him, I would be alone for the rest of my life as no other man would be willing to deal with me. My own mother would even defend his actions if I complained about it to her. After two years of abuse, he dumped me in a very publicly humiliating way, making a huge scene about how I was the worst girlfriend anyone could have and told me to kill myself. I took a bottle of Benadryl and had the most traumatizing experience of my life.

A few days after my suicide attempt, my ex had messaged me on Facebook again and I told him everything that had happened. I was in a terrible state so I was so relieved when I realized he still wanted me. I was afraid that I would be alone for the rest of my life and hated myself severely so, at the time, he was my knight in shining armor. We talked very frequently over the next few months, he told me he loved me every single day. We even talked about our plans for when he got out of the military. He promised that we would get married, have children, and he would fullfill my purpose as a woman by making me a wife and mother. I was raised to believe that all I was good for was to be a sex toy for my husband and a baby factory, so I believed that I wasn't good for anything else.

He came home from Japan for Christmas and he invited me over to his place. I was so happy and excited to see him after so long. He was my happiness. My everything. Without him, I had no other reason to be alive. We had sex. It lasted two minutes and I was left unsatisfied. I had been on birth control for several months because he insisted that he never wanted to wear a condom with me. I didn't feel comfortable with it but we were going to be married so I thought it was okay. I even took a plan B pill as well, just to be safe. He dumped me the next day...just like before.

His friend has told me that he had actually been serious with a Japanese girl for about a year. I confronted him about it and he confirmed it. He told me that he never loved me and that I was nothing but a cum dumpster. He said, I fullfilled my duties and told me to kill myself. He even turned our mutual friends against me, telling them that I was crazy and trying to make up lies about him. I had to delete my social media to escape all the harassment I received. About a month later, his girlfriend somehow got my number and started sending me pictures of the two of them together.

I had lost everything and thought my life was over, so I got a account back and messaged him, telling him I was pregnant and that I needed money for an abortion. He was terrified and believed me immediately without even asking for proof. He sent me around $500 and I took it. I even pretended to have second thoughts so that he could ""convince"" me that aborting the baby was the right thing to do and that he would kill himself if I didn't. He was Pro-life as well, which I found ironic. About a week later, I told him that it was done and told him how traumatizing the experience was for me. He then, had a meltdown. He said that he was scum and that he'd never forgive himself for the trauma he put me though and even offered me more money as ""compensation"" which I refused. He checked himself into a psych ward and haven't heard from him since. Last time we talked, he said he would kill himself as soon as he was done with the military.

It's been over a year since and I have since gotten a lot of therapy and realized that I allowed people to treat me like trash due to my low self esteem. I could could blame it on my abusive mother for teaching me that that's how I deserved to be treated but I still could've walked away from the abuse from my ex's at any point. I just thought I was abused because I deserved it. I now live a much more stable life with a great job, new friends, and a wonderful therapist. What I did still haunts me and I know I could never take it back. I still don't use Facebook and I am still single. I need to do more work on myself before I go into another relationship. I've been researching red-flags in relationships and also been learning to trust my gut about people. I know my worth now and refuse to settle for abusive assholes ever again.

I’m also the neighbour of a vile man and his much kinder wife (a vet) who I love less dearly. 

Anyway, my neighbour hates my dog and generally my family for one reason or another and has been since we moved in 5 years ago. 

He particularly hates my dog for some reason maybe because unlike him he is happy and has people that love him (but of course this is only a suggestion). 

Anyway, last month my dad was out of town at his brothers birthday celebration in Ireland and left the rest of the family back at home in our home country England. Now it is important to mention that my neighbour, henceforth known as EN - evil neighbour is scared of my dad and won’t try anything around him as my dad is tall and physically imposing whilst EN is 5’9” and thin is a blade of grass.

Anyway, my fool of a brother (I don’t blame him for what happened, he’s only 12 and made a mistake) accidentally left the back door unlocked whilst returning from walking the dog and none of us checked the door after. 

So that night at roughly 10:30 we heard an intense barking from my dog (who sleeps on an old mattress by the back door) barking and squealing in agony. All of us ran downstairs and saw our neighbour flash past the window and more horrifically our family dog with cuts all over, mostly of him snout, paws and hind legs. 

We were horrified and rushed him to an emergency vet where he spent about 4 days and eventually returned home with stitches and as a shadow of himself. 

We confronted our neighbour about it (my dad being home at this point) and he denied everything but we still saw him and knew it was him so commenced in our revenge. 

So you may remember me mentioning that his wife was a vet earlier in the story and this is where it comes in handy. As we took him to an emergency vet due to the late time the event happened at we hadn’t been to his usual vet; where EN’s wife worked...

We decided to make a follow up visit and once at the vet directly requested her, she was horrified to see the state of our dog and wanted to know what could’ve happened to him. 

We explained the whole story to her, talking about seeing EN and suspecting him, and her face turned pale white muttering something along the lines of “he wouldn’t...”

She basically told us that she caught him coming home late that night seemingly out of breath with dirty clothes and was suspicious. He was already a crummy husband and I think the suspicion of hurting an innocent animal pushed her over the edge

Was in a 24 hour coffee shop doing school work, went outside to take a piss. As I'm walking back, I notice 2 kids in full back clothing running across the street and almost get hit by a car. I shrug it off and continue walking back. As I get back to the entrance, some tall guy is panting and asks me if I can hear him, because I had my bluetooth earbuds in, said yes and he told me my laptop was stolen. 

I asked him if he was joking, he said no, he said he tried to grap the kid and tells me this as I'm walking back to my place. Lone behold my laptop is gone. The good samaritan had already talked to the manager of the place and they were already calling the local rent a cops. (Not your average rent a cops, these dudes had guns). They took my statement and then we all start waiting for the cops as the property security starts going through video surveillance. They find an ok pic of the kids face. I have to admit I'm dumbfounded the kid tried it here considering the place is nationally known and there are cameras everywhere. 

We sat around realizing no one actually called the cops, we called them, we all waited, they arrived. Cops got my statement and the witnesses. Then the manager comes out with the phone. Both the property security and the cops see what they can learn from the phone. (This is where it gets good)

So the kids phone is on a group chat via Instagram or something, his notifications keep popping up on the lock screen where everyone could read a bit of it, the group is literally talking about how the kid lost his phone. Whomever involved kept trying to call it. The property security is a chick so she goes into undercover mode, calls the number that called the kids phone, and pretends to be some innocent girl that found the phone. She proceeds to flirt w the boys, follows them on Instagram, shes like ""you're cute"", they say ""you too"" the dudes give her their numbers and such. She even got the type and color of car they were driving out of them. (They apparently parked off site and took off after). Turns out they wanted to meet on the other side of the city to collect the phone. Its at least 10 miles away. The conversation and such goes on for about an hour. All of the cops just huddled around the phone while the girl is flirting with them getting info. They finally catch on, girl is blocked etc. But.... she hits the home button.. ""hey siri, call mom"". The cops actually got to call the parents and next day or last night, went and talked to the dad. The kid lives a sub city away and now has a warrant. Oh, last detail, I just got the computer back from factory for repair that day so I had the serial number on the receipt. On top of that, it was a computer the school gave to me so hopefully I can get a replacement from them if the kids torched the lap top. Cop told me it's a matter of time before the kid gets picked up. 

It's a high school kid so I dont want him to have a record, but depending on the shape of my laptop, or revenge, probably gonna press charges, on top of the charges he has from stealing out of the coffee shop.

TLDR at the bottom.


This happened about a year ago. I had just returned from a business related trip to the frozen north (Canada) of which I had been gone for about 8 months. During this time my wife had kept me apprised of everything going on in the neighborhood, as well as her suspicion that our new neighbors behind us (henceforth known as DDN for Drug Dealing Neighbors) were dealing drugs. Since I'm all about keeping my family safe, I install security cameras all around and inside my house.


Most of my neighbors were perfectly fine with the cameras, and a few asked if I could set theirs up if they bought them. DDN, however, was not pleased. He waited until I was heading out to my car and confronted me, DEMANDING I take them down.


DDN: HEY! Take those mother-fin cameras down. I don't need no one knowin' my s!


Me: No. They're watching my property. Can't see into your yard at all.


DDN: Man, F*** YOU! Take those s***s down or I will!


Me: I ever see you on my property, you'll leave in a body bag.


At this point I know my wife's suspicions were well founded. I watched the camera feeds and started noting that he had a lot of quick visitors around 3 am. Cars would pull up in front of MY driveway, he'd meet them, exchanges were made and the cars would leave. Not too long after, I got a motion alert on 2 of my cameras and my dogs started going nuts. I saw my front door handle move. It's go time. I grab my shotgun and rush to the front door, but as soon as I tried opening it my beagle tried bolting outside, howling at the trespassers. Unable to deal with him AND properly hold a 12 gauge, I opt to keep my dog and yelled at the 2 men standing there to get the f*** off my property. That night, my motorcycle was stolen (they broke the locks off) and every camera on the ground floor had to be repositioned/ replaced. I checked the footage and watched as DDN walked up to them and hit them. I was done being a bystander.


I contacted the police, but even with security footage, they claimed there was nothing they could do. I was furious. I knew who did it, had the proof, and there was nothing I could do about it...yet.


For the next couple days I studied municipal and building codes. I started filling report after report on my DDN. Broken down cars in the yard, that's a violation. Broken gutters hanging off the roof, that's a violation. Barking dogs after 10pm, that's a violation. I nickel and dimed them for anything I could hoping to goad them in to doing something. I put tainted gas in a gas can on the back of my Jeep (which was unsurprisingly stolen) and suddenly their dirt bike engine blew up the next night. DDN confronted me again, threatening that if the complaints didn't stop, he couldn't guarantee my dogs or my wife would be safe. Heated words were exchanged, he stormed up to me, and the encounter ended with weapons drawn and both of us going back inside our homes. Finally, the coup de grace: remember the security footage of DDN's late night visitors? I filed a report with the Counter-Narcotics Division and included EVERYTHING. License plate numbers, car models and colors, all the information I'd gathered for the past few months. They got enough security footage for a search warrant, and the other evidence made sure it wasn't a ""friendly"" visit.


I got to watch the security cameras as SWAT descended on their house. I got to see DDN and everyone else led out in handcuffs. I later found out that the dogs I had called about were being bred and used as bait dogs. The police confiscated a small arsenal and enough drugs that those assholes won't be out of jail until I'm retired.

Well this happened about 3 weeks ago. For context  fb guy is guy, and motorcycle thief is well thief. My motorcycle is a bashan bsr (for those who don’t know its a Chinese dual sport motorcycle). I start Monday morning off blurry eyed and half conscious to go to work. I leave my bike on the front porch because I never expected anyone to steal the ducking thing. Anyway I trudge through Monday and get home at about 5pm, as I pull up I notice something odd. My porch seems awfully barren for some reason and it hits me like a truck. My wife greets me at the door and I asked her “honey where is my bike?” as the color drains from her face she says “oh please no”. Not wanting to believe it I check my shed thinking I just forgot I put it back there. Ta dah, no bike there either. I immediately call the fuzz to file a report. Our chief rolls up and gets my info, pics of the bike, vin, ect. (At the time I had a security camera system but hadn't installed it yet). After he leaves, I feel defeated and go and set in my house and stew on in for a few minutes. I have a neighbor across the way from me that has a bike on his porch too. Not wanting him to go through the same thing as me, I casually walk over and lay down what happened. As we talk he points to a camera in the corner of his carport that points at my house. He says give me a bit and ill hunt down the footage of the thief snatching your bike. Feeling a bit relieved the there maybe footage of this porch pirate grabbing my bike, I go home, he comes and gives me the footage a bit later. In my desperation, I post on fb a reward for anything that gets my two wheels of fun back to me (knowing my local Arkansas police dept I would never see the thing again). I go to bed feeling sick about the whole situation. I crawl into work the next day and fb messenger pings my phone to life with a new message. Low and behold a guy gets a hold of me and sends me pics of the guy trying to trade my bike for his(he turned him down). We talk for a minute and I thank him for the info. A few minutes later a brilliant Idea pops into my head. Que sneak mode, I message guy back and ask if he would be willing to work with me on setting up a time for his “friend that was wanting a cheap bike” to buy said bike from thief. Guy says “sure I'm down with that”. They go back and forth and thief agrees to a meet and greet with guys friend “Adam”. Thief isn't the smartest cookie in the bunch and sends me the wrong text app number and I never hear from him. No text, call nothing, about 6 hours passes and I message guy back and tell him thief never responded. Guy messages thief back as says “Adam” messaged you and he said you never said anything. Thief asks for “Adams” number, he calls. I pick up the phone calm and collected but know ill end up breaking down quick with rage if I don’t get in and out. Thief says he has had it for about 2 months, I agree to buy the bike and meet in a big public place at 12 the next day. Feeling like im gonna nail him I call and tell my boss what was going on and get the day off for the next day. Next day rolls around, I call my dad to borrow his truck so I can meet the guy in a vehicle he has never seen (considering he looked at my truck and my wife's car). I make it to town and call the local police and ask them to send a cruiser and tell them the situation. The cop takes my info and gives me his number and hides behind a building and tells me to text him when he pulls up. The waiting game starts and im nervous, feeling like I could have spooked him at any time during our interaction on the phone. I wait for an hour at the parking lot im at and the cop says he cant stay there any longer. I message the cop and tell him thank you for your time. I have my wife message some of her old friends from back in the day to see if they can get a bead on him. She gets a hit from one of her friends saying thief came to them and asked them to help him sell the bike (Thief had another stolen bike with a pic and showed a shed with some background I recognized). Her friend says he may have the bike stashed at thief's dads house and I drive back to my hometown. I proceed to skim my hometown in the sketcher part of town but come up with nothing. Im to the point of giving up but decide one last push for anything. I pull up thief’s fb profile(he has about 3) and manage to find out who his dad is and he uses fb messenger. I don’t want his dad tipping off thief but im out of options. But I relent and call thief's father on fb messenger and he picks up. I tell him everything and he is super nice, I tell him I'm not mad or spiteful to you but I just want my property back from his son. He agrees and apologized profusely, he tells me he will call him and tells him to give it up (I didn’t believe for a second thief would do that). I go home and wait. About an hour later I receive a message from thief's dad asking me for my number for his son to call me. About 5 minutes later I received a call from thief, I am in utter disbelief. He gives me a sob story, to which I just keep saying OK where is my bike? He sends me text of the address of where he left the bike. I pack back up and head back to town and call the towns pd again and they have two cruisers meet me and escort me to the location. When I say im nervous in this part of town that is an understatement. We get the bike and my wife tells me she physically seen my stress leave my body. We load the bike up and head back home. But the story isn't finished, this whole time I had been been keeping the my hometown pd informed on everything. Chief calls me and asks “do you want to press charges, my suggestion is don’t let him have any slack” Duck yes I do. I head to the pd and sign an affidavit against thief for thief by receiving and criminal mischief. (I have messages guy screenshot of him trying to trade/sell the bike) I sign the papers and get home to do damage control. Thief ripped apart the ignition to get it started, and took a screwdriver to the gas cap. Pissed but happy the bike is back with me I lock the bike up and order new parts and forget about him. About a week later I get the urge to check local records and see if they have picked him up. Boy did they, added a felony to his rap sheet and I burst into laughter seeing his mug shot. Thank you all for reading, I will try to get some pics uploaded of the damage he had did. I give anyone permission to use this story for whatever.

on my tablet so hope this turns out ok.

This happened to me a few years ago, I had recently moved to the north of Scotland where I now live and was staying with my mum and stepdad while getting a house sorted, they went away on holiday for a fortnight so missed all the fun.

I came home from work one afternoon (started at 0400 and finished at 1330) to find a car blocking the driveway into my house! Having a small car, I parked at the top of the drive blocking them in (my parents live out in the sticks on a single track road so I couldn’t leave my car where it was because I would have been blocking the road).

After an hour I saw someone approaching the drive and taking pictures of my car!! I went out and confronted them and the conversation went like this.

Me.. why are you taking pictures of my car?

EP.. because your parked illegally and blocking my car in, I’m going to call the police if you don’t move your car from my neighbour drive!

Me.. this is my clearly parents drive, did you not think it was odd having to walk out of someone’s garden to get into neighbour?

EP.. well it wasn’t very clear so can you move so I can get out.

So I get my keys and move, then park my car and think nothing of it

Next morning I leave for work and once again I find the same car parked in my parents drive! This time I go knock on my neighbours door and ask him to get his friend to shift it... only for my neighbour to ask “what friend”? I pointed to the car and told him what had happened yesterday, turns out the prat wasn’t his friend at all but liked to walk round the woodland path near our houses.

20 minutes later he finally appears, smirks and moves before saying

EP.. I’ll be parked here tomorrow too

So once again I go to work at stupid o’clock and when I get back, lo and behold, the prat has parked their again! This time I decided to teach him a lesson, I had 2 days off so I went to the shops and got some shopping and a rather large amount of alcohol (Strongbow and Savannah dry cider if your interested), got home, parked as close to his car as I could, making sure I was safely off the road.

I went inside, made some dinner and started drinking, about an hour later there’s a banging on the door.

Me.. yes

EP.. move your car it’s blocking me in and my family want to go home.  I look out and there’s his rather embarrassed looking family sitting in their car.

Me.. sorry can’t (as I took another drink from my cider) been drinking for a couple of hours, probably over the limit so I don’t want to risk it.

EP.. WHAT!!!! Why are you drinking when you knew I’d be wanting to move my car

Me.. I’m off for the next 2 days so I fancied a drink

EP.. I’M CALLING THE FUCKING POLICE

Me.. you do that.  Before shutting the door and popping into the lounge to watch tv while also watching them through the window.  About 2 hours (apparently they police had trouble finding my house lol) later the police arrive and speak to EP before they knock on my door.

Me.. yes officers how can I help

PO1.. why are you stopping EP from leaving? So I began explaining the events of the previous days and mentioned how I’d told him he couldn’t park here, I also explained that I had been drinking and was probably over the limit so I couldn’t risk moving my car!

PO1 &amp; 2 agreed that I was correct to not drive while intoxicated, they then asked what insurance I had. I pointed out that it’s was named driver only (basically means that only people who’s name is on the insurance can drive my car) so they couldn’t move it for me.

EP.. COME ON JUST MAKE HIM MOVE HIS CAR

PO2.. just going to get the breathalyser... blow into this please (to me)... your about 2 times the legal limit, so I’m sorry but you can’t move your car

PO1.. (to EP) sorry but he’s over the limit, you’ll have to leave your car here and come back tomorrow 

EP.. WHAT! But how are we meant to get home

Me.. bus stop about 2 miles down that road, you’ll get the bus to (insert city) at this time, or (insert town) at this time 

EP.. but the bus doesn’t go anywhere near where we live...

PO2.. We can call you a taxi if you want, but you’ll need to pay for it

EP.. he did this deliberately! 

Me.. yup lol

Fast forward to the next day the police arrive with him in their car and before they ask me to move my car they decided to have some fun

PO1.. we just want to check you with the breathalyser again... big deep breath... 

EP looking more and more worried 

PO2.. your fine, can you move your car please 

Me.. of course officers 

PO1.. to EP.. don’t park your car here again

EP couldn’t even look at me, just got in his car and drove off, later that day I decided to build a gate for my parents

I clearly know I wasn't loading it wrong but I asked him how he wanted me to load it then, considering I'm the only person out of the entire warehouse on both shifts who loads exports, and have been doing this job for a year. For reference I was loading it in the way the company standards stated me to and the way I was trained. He gets heated after I asked that question and says *Think of it yourself and fuck off*. 

Okay, cool, I didn't appreciate that remark, but I let it slide. I changed the way I loaded the exports in a way I thought he wanted me to load (considering he never actually stated how he wanted me to load) and Bob comes in again a week later. Bob sees me loading the export container and asks why I'm loading it the way I was. I explained to him i was loading it differently because he told me to. 

Bob told me to *fuck off* and load it the way I was the other night. I get off my forklift, take off my badge, hand it to bob and say *Fuck off Bob, load it yourself*. I head upstairs, take off my freezer suit and leave anything related to the company in my locker. 

I had four exports to load that night, I was halfway through the first load, with nobody else knowing how to load exports. I go home, shut my phone off and go to sleep. I wake up the next day relieved and rested. I get a call a week later asking me to come back because they have nobody to load the exports, nobody knows how to and that they really needed me. Nope, if you're gonna treat me like a piece of shit then I'll do the same. 

Bob tried showing his dominance as the newly promoted Ops manager, but he did it in the completely wrong way. Don't tell me to fuck off. I may let it slide once, but when you tell me to fuck off twice, then I'm done. It's unprofessional.

It was 2007 and we were in our last year of high school. I was in a relationship of 2 years with a hot, cute, nice guy. Everything was smooth and nice until he started to be controlling and aggressive, and we used to fight every other day. One day he got to the point that he physically threatened me, not really hit me but violently pinned me down while having an argument. I finally had enough and dumped him right away.

The following weeks were all about him begging me: flowers, cute romantic playlists on a CD, pathetic scenes with him on his knees crying and begging me to forgive him, even his mother called me to let me know he wasn't eating, all the jazz. Luckily, I was adamant about not wanting to be in that kind of relationship but he really seemed penitent and willing to go back to ""normal"". 

One day my best friend came to me, had me sit down and handed me some papers. 
The day before he was at a friend's house, and mistakenly logged into our friend's little sister (15yo, we were 17) MSN. He saw a conversation with my ex, got suspicious and went through it. He printed out 50+ pages of the worst shit. The girl had a huge crush on him. He lured her into sneaky conversations, and some day they hooked up. Eventually he began to blackmail her saying that if she wouldn't give him bjs he would have told everybody and expose her like a big slut. 

Here's how I handled it:

1. I began to search for ""hot"" chat rooms, explicitly flirt with the weirdest guys I could find and give them ""my"" number to have some sexting. I think he got at least 20 dickpics in a couple of weeks, plus some creepy calls. Eventually, he had to change his number;

2. I sneaked into his house (his mother insisted that I got a spare key because she was often out of town and he wasn't very reliable, and I hadn't returned it yet) and proceeded to spread a whole pack of stinky cheese under his mattress (hopefully the smell would have worsened a lot before he could have it figured out); 

3. I put a few drops of super glue into his motorcycle key slot, just enough to have the key stop before reaching the right position to work;

4. As a grand finale, I got in touch with that poor girl, we had a talk, and we managed to team up. We even reached out to his ex (I was slightly suspicious about something going on with her but I thought I was being paranoid... Nope, I was right, he repeatedly tried to hit on her but she rejected him and was super annoyed). We went out to dinner, the three of us, like old friends... At the diner he was working at. We pretended we didn't know him the whole time, but we brought along all the conversations printed out and spent the night reading them aloud and laughing, discussing about what a douchebag he was right in front of him, while he had to act normally since he was working. 

Eventually (since we were in a small town and most of the people he used to hang out with were in my group of friends), he moved with his sister, in another town, right after high school graduation.

This apartment was new but had been vacant for the better part of two years, and came with two parking spaces right near the entrance of the underground parking, pretty much in front of the main ramp.

The thing is that since the apartment had been empty for a while, most people assumed those spaces were visitors parking, unassigned spaces that people used when visitors came or when they needed to unload something. They where always assigned to the apartment, just that since no one lived there, no one cared. Until we moved in.

At first, some people accused us of invading those parking spaces, claiming that they didn't belong to us, and that we could not use them. They filled complains, which where dismissed by the administration. However something different started happening, we started seeing cars invading our parking spaces. At first we didn't complain and didn't think much of it. Change is hard for some people, right?

After a while we filed a complain expecting something to happen. The administration also dismissed it, saying that ""they are looking into the problem""

After like a month my dad had enough. Atleast once a week he had to street park because some moron had taken over his parking space. But not today. 

For a bit of context, these parking spaces are two parallel parking spaces, where you park one car in front of the other. (I can dig up a picture if this isn't clear) so this we where at the mall. When we arrived home, this Kia truck is sitting in our parking space. Annoyed, we did what we always had to do, go to the security desk, to get them to call the owner so they would move their car. 

So they called up the guy, who went pretty much ""I don't understand what the problem is. That is public parking. I'm going to file a complain against whoever is saying they own that parking space because it's a lie. They are stealing and I'm going to make them pay. Can you tell me the name of whoever is asking me to move my car? Because I'm also going to talk with my lawyer too, and with the administration, because this can't continue happening""

So, in a fit of rage, my dad took his truck, parked it right in front leaving just a couple of inches between his rear bumper and the Kia truck, leaving it there, with no space to pull it out. And then left. The guard just looked at him with the ""I don't get paid enough to deal with this"" look and walked back to the security desk.

So 11pm came around and we hear our phone ringing

""The owner of the Kia truck is here and can't leave""

""Well he had the chance of leaving before. Tell him to file a complain""

And hung up.

12am comes by, people are knocking at our front door. They are getting desperate. You can hear them. Then 1am comes by, again our phone rings, this time it is the guard and the cops. That's our parking space, they can't tow our car. 

The next morning comes by and this guy is back, again knocking at our door saying that he is going to sue us. Oh well, I guess we are not going out today either. This was a Sunday. Monday rolls by, my dad leaves on my mom's truck, that Kia is still there. Wednesday comes by, and my dad gets a phone call, it's from the administration. They got the point and are pretty much begging my dad to let them get that truck out of there before stuff gets out of hand, they say that are going to get a sign made that says that it isn't visitors parking, and make sure there is a camera pointed at out parking so whoever parks there is on recording. My dad finally gives in and let's the guy move the truck, after 5 days.

I work with several companies and have a few books published. In short, literature is my bag. With that established, let's continue. 

I was just going through my old creative writing work from university and found my utter favourite group project! It was a lovely 7000 short story that me and my co-writer were to make for our course, all the way back in 2008. The story was to be a play on the standard hard-boiled detectives type of thing. 

Well... when I say that it was 7000 words, it was actually meant to be a 10000 word piece. That was the outline for the group project. The last few pages of the document, which I've kept all these years, are just screenshots of the email that my partner on the project sent me at 1am the night before the project was due to be handed in, ""Hey dude, what part of the work stuff do I still need to do? I didn't check, lol"", and my reply being ""your half of the work, like we discussed several times over the last few months.""

So yeah, I had written a good chunk more than my even share of the work. That email was then printed out, stapled into the print-out of the story, handed in, marked and graded! When our lecturer graded it, he mentioned that it had a 'disappointing ending' which was taken into account - I passed, and my partner did not.

Last spring, I finished my minor hockey career, meaning I’d have to enter the wild world of men’s league. In November, I joined a local hockey Facebook group to find a place to play. That evening, I saw a dude looking for players to have a casual game at a local arena, 10pm, Sunday night. I commented, was told the cost was 20$, deal, I was in. 

I showed up and was told I’d be playing on the white team. I noticed that all my teammates didn’t know each other, were wearing different jerseys and that the opposing team had matching custom orange jerseys, orange socks, they all got along just fine. We hit the ice, and it was instantly apparent that the orange team played together often. They had set plays, and passed around our team with ease. 

We thought we’d be showing up for a casual, no-contact game, but team orange was in it to win. They played hard, swinging their sticks at anyone who touched the puck, tripping players and taking plenty of penalties with no referee to call it. Eventually, they got bored of skating circles around a bunch of randoms, and starting trying to hit members of my team. I played all star hockey growing up, I naturally played with my head up, aware of my surroundings, but my teammates weren’t so lucky. Most of them were getting run over while the orange team laughed and mocked them. The game ended early when half of my team left, injured and realizing they’d paid 20$ to get run over and embarrassed by these guys.

I stuck around in the dressing room after, and made sure to ask lots of questions. I sat next to the team captain, and soon found out that the orange team was an actual beer league team, that played together every weekend. They played their league games on Saturday night, then rented the ice every Sunday night to “practice.” Their idea of practice was getting a team of randoms together via Facebook, advertising the session as a casual skate, then pummelling them for fun. He said that a lot of guys wouldn’t come back to play again, complaining about the hitting, saying the skate was not fun, and it was getting hard to find people to play, but he didn’t really care and found it funny, plus he was making a profit. 

After watching this guy and his team con 11 guys out of 220$ total, promise them a fun game, then beat them up, and play unfairly against them, I wanted to do something. I could’ve taken it up with the admin of the hockey group, that would be too easy and no fun. That weekend, I payed close attention to the Facebook group. Sure enough, on Friday night, the captain posted the same ad I saw last weekend. Within minutes, the comments were flooding with a handful of players, about to be tricked like I was. I quickly PMed all the players, notifying them of what this guy was up to, they were surprised, but thanked me for telling them. Sure enough, they all went back to the comments to cancel on him, using various fake excuses. The next day, the captain posted a desperate ad, followed by another on Sunday morning. Less and less people commented. Perfect.

I did this for a couple of weeks, messaging players and telling them to avoid this guy and his team, nobody snitched on me, and slowly he stopped posting in the group. Interested to see if he’d cancelled his practices altogether, I called the rink, and asked if the ice was booked on Sunday night at 10. The rink attendant said that a beer league team was practicing at that time, and it was the only open ice available for the winter. Learn to skate sessions were on weekend mornings, minor hockey games happened on weekend afternoons/evenings, and junior games happened on weekend nights, beer league games happened late night Saturday, and the beer league team always booked practice on Sunday night, nobody else wanted that time slot, and often went to other rinks. If it was the only open ice time, what if I went the extra step, and took it from them?

The orange team captain always booked his session on Friday nights, so I called the rink on Thursday night, hoping I wouldn’t be asked for a down payment, and asked to book Sunday night for the next month. I told the attendant that I was running an adult learn-to-skate session, fake name, fake company, everything. They gave me the time slots and told me I could pay on Sunday night, before the skate. I owned the slot now, and there was nothing that captain cuck could do about it. 

To avoid having to actually pay for the ice time, and to avoid being a no show, I’d call every Sunday morning, and cancel my session for that night, claiming my fake skating class couldn’t get any members to register. Cancelled ice time would become an open skating session, meaning that families, couples, anyone could pay a small fee and come skate, so the rink wouldn’t lose any money. Too late for the captain to be able to book his practice, but enough time for the rink to open a free skate session. After a month, I figured that the captain didn’t bother with trying to book Sunday night anymore, so I told the rink attendant that my learn to skate company flopped, and that I wouldn’t need to book Sunday night anymore. 

This whole fiasco lasted about a month and a half to 2 months, from November to January. Never heard from the captain or his team. He hasn’t posted in the group since, so I’m assuming that they don’t have their “practices” anymore. Last I heard, the 10pm Sunday night session was booked by a beginner adult league, where a lot of men and women were learning to play for the first time. I’d like to think that I’m partially responsible for the opening of that beginner league, if you’re out there and you’re learning to play because I stole ice time from a shitty beer league team, you’re welcome. I’ve found a new place to play, with a great group of guys.

This happened a little less than a year ago. We had a brand new professor that had never taught alone before. (This is college btw. She is roughly mid 30's to early 40's while the entire class is early 20's to late 20's.) And she was like a ticking time bomb. We never knew if she was gonna be in a good mood or a bad mood because both classes she taught were night time and she would come from her other job working for a large company.

When she was in a good mood, it was always a fake Disney-looking smile all the time and obvious fake laugh and when she was in a bad mood she would yell at students and insult student's work if she didn't like it.

She caused more than half of the class to have multiple mental break downs throughout the semester. (Including me who had to go on heavy anti-anxiety medication so I didn't have a breakdown and stop functioning normally.) She would grade based on all or nothing. If she didn't like it, you got a big fat 0 and couldn't resubmit after the final submission. She would also not tell us the full details of the assignment, then would get pissed when the class didn't complete what she wanted. She also would add details to assignments if she was in a bad mood and make the assignment stricter than it already was. She would get pissed if the class asked too many questions and would sound like she was gonna legit cry if students stood up to her. Like, her voice would start sounding shaky and would crack. And we would rarely stand up and if we did, we tried to be as respectful as possible because we all knew, if we are respectful and she's not, that helps our cause.

She also NEVER taught in either of the classes, it was always ""here is your assignment."" and the only time she even tried to teach was when the head of the program decided to sit in during the class after hearing all the things that have been happening. And even then, it was a crappy power point presentation that she just read word for word off the screen. And even with the head of the program there, she still thought it would be a good idea to yell at students in front of him which prompted me to have a break down and him chase after me after I bolted out of class. Which I explained my side of everything to him for an hour alone because I was one of the only students that had not spoken with him at the time. Which he was shocked to hear some of the things he had not heard from other students.

She also tried to scam the class into creating something for free for her brother's job and when we brought up that we should be paid for it, (We would be doing roughly $1500-$2000 worth of work for free and we were asking for $1000 split between a group of 5 students.) she told us that it should be an honor that our work was being used in the real world (""You'll be paid in exposure 4Head"") and that we don't need to be paid and that her brother was dedicating his ""precious"" time for us. But when we also brought up that the work of the students legally belongs to the college and she couldn't use it without paying for it, she got pissed and yelled at us.

Thankfully the entire class was talking with each other outside of class and talking with the head of our program and letting him know what's going on since he knows all of us by heart. She sadly couldn't be fired during the semester so we had to deal with her which for most of us, it was our last class before graduating. He assured us she wouldn't tank our GPA's right before we graduated and he was very understanding about our side of the situation.

I learned that she had to be asked to come back in order to continue working there, which the head of our program did not do. So thankfully she is no longer a professor making life miserable for students. And during the semester, according to students who aren't even doing the same program as us, she already had a reputation as one of the worst teachers at the college.

Also if she somehow happens to see this, I truly don't care, the way I worded this post, is me being nice to her. And if she doesn't want something bad written about her, maybe she should think twice about treating students poorly. And I really pray I never have to have another encounter with her ever again. Whether it be for teaching or professionally.

Mom

MFF:My Friend's Father

Richard: The Theaf(not hes real name)

So long time ago when i was a little kid my Mom was in a pretty tough situatin. She devorced  and had to took care of me, my older brother and my litte brother, who has asperger so he needed special treetmant. My Father didn't left us but the devorce was so frash and so paniful, that he refused to help her, just us the kids. It was a wierd situation, becouse my Mom got costudy but she didn't want my fathers money, so she didn't got a much child suport. Long story short: My father made good, my mother was poor (of course my father always fighted ford costudy but thats a story for an other subreddit)

Anyway, at the time my Mom had a little store in a small town selling sewing machines but mostly used gadgets. She bought and sell stuff to make a living and if you want to make a living on that market, u have to make diels people, who you don't even want to contact if you have a right mind. There comes Richard in the picture. He was a petty theaf and a drogaddict, who always wanted to sell stuff to my mum( yes, probably some of them was stolen item, never asked my Mom,that she ever bought something from him, i like to belive no, and i never saw police officers in the store and i spent a lot of time in there at the time). So one time my Mom collected the cash from the cashier to take it to the bank, and unluky timeing, Richard comes in to ask some questions. He got a good opportunity to steal my Moms wallet, and her phone. Eventually my Mom Dind' press crarges but she managed to blackmail back some of the money and her phone, but she lost 1600 dollar worth of money. Needles to say, next tho debt what was mother owned to the bank at that time it was a really shock for our family but becouse we wherelittle we didn't know about this at that time.

Time is going forward and i'm going to highscool and too thing happens. Fist of all MF's house got completly destroyed! You MFF had thing called Recinklyng money. He alway borrow and loan money and i think this time he owend too much, so one of the guys he owned hired some dude to destroy his house in revange! Gues who was the lucky guy who got this job! Thats right, it was Richard! He never got cought by the police becouse of this, but he took a too many visits in MFFs Hamburger restorant and asking questions about the invastigation. After some time it was obvios that, that idiot did it, but there was not enough evedance to prove it. But now he got a biiiig enemy, and it didn't take a long time to now unveil Richards drogbuisniss. So enteully he was a stupid petty criminal and got 8 years in prison, for far not the worst thing he did. MFF had a contact, who had a contact in prison, who wrote latters in every month about the guys in the local buisnesses who got cought. That will be important later.

The second thing what happened is: My Mom finally come out of the deep and also got a knew husbend. A husbend who accidantly worked int the prisen as the second guy in the medical appartment. Becouse my Mom long ago took a nursing scool (Didn't finish it becouse of marrige) my new stepfather got her a new job in the medical apartment.

And now the revenge: At this point Richard almost lost all of his mind becouse of drugs (yes in prison too) and didn't recognise my Mom. I mean... he did but not quite. For some reason he tough she was her doctor out of town! He sad big hellos to her and sad to her things like ""Hey Doctor! Doctor! Do you recognise me? You where best doctor in town!"" ect. At one point my Mom lost, looked around it and the next conversation follow:

\-Richard shut up! I was not your doctor! I was never a doctor! You know me, becouse one time you robbed me, so don't try my patiens!

\-But... no... no i never...

\-Yes you did! Now shut up and go back to your place.

Richard was in shocked, locked down to the ground and obayed. Now there is one imprtant rule in the prison: Be friends with everyone in the medical apartment, becouse, they have all the medicine, and drugs! So two really big guy heard the conversation (such as everyone,it was loud :D ) and went to my Mom and they asked:

\- Should we... you know... revard him?

My Mom looked around. No guards nerby. She quiatly answeard:

\- You can.. just little. 'Wink.

The two guys noded, and when the guards came back this two guy standed around Richard all time when they leaved the medical apartment.

Do you remeber the letter thing? Well a little time pass and in a conversation between me and MF somehow come up Richard. He sad to me this:

My Father didn't left us, but the devorce was so freash and so painfull, that he refused to help her, just us the kids.

Needles to say, it was a really big shock for our family. Becouse we where little we didn't know about this at that time.

His daughter, about ten years older then me, was staying in the other not as nice guest room with her dog, since I was paying to rent the nice room. She tried to bully me into switching, even though she was only going to be there for two or three months, and even taught her dog to chew on my clothes when I brought my laundry out. 

Well, two weeks into her being there, I had found out that one of my best friends during highschool that had moved away was going to have a baby. I spent hours, *days*, hand sewing the cutest little dino plushy for my friends baby. When I came back after going out with a different friend, I found the ladys dog on the floor with the torn up plush. I flipped. I screamed, scaring the dog off, and gathered it all up. The landlords daughter faked innocence asking ""oh, was that yours? Well, you shouldn't have just let it laying around."" 

It had been in a box in my room, on a shelf that I needed a stool to reach. 

So, I tell my landlord, and he asks me to just let it go. She's going through some things, and she'd be leaving in a couple months anyway. But I couldn't do it. I had to spend more money to pay for more material, and now I couldn't trust that she wouldn't ruin that one either. So I came up with a plan. 

She left her dog alone in the house at night when she'd go out and party. And she had a suitcase that had most of her stuff in it. One weekend while she was out, I went into her room, and flipped open the suitcase. And I just... Left. The dog was in there, so my work was already done. I went to bed. 

Next morning, I wake up to my landlords daughter *screaming*. Her dog must had *really* wanted to chew shit up, because every single thing she had in that suitcase was destroyed. Clothes, hair dryer, toiletries, adult toys. All of it, smashed and broken and torn up. Because she had taught her dog it was okay to chew on my things, her dog chewed on *everything*. Then, she tried to beat her dog. My landlord got pissed. He gave her a verbal thrashing as said she had to leave, within a week, and he was keeping the dog. She tried to get out of it, but she did eventually leave. 

I loved out a year later, and now rent from one of my other family friends. My old landlord still has the dog. I did end up remaking the plushy for my friends baby, and finished judt in time.

He’s an idiot with a micro penis, so he owns a big dumb F150 with light bars and a big fat unnecessarily loud exhaust. I’m a car guy and I love a loud exhaust, but dudes with jacked trucks that don’t even see gravel roads are idiots. He didn’t even work on the truck himself, just bought it that way from some other idiot.  

The problem is that he has remote start....and uses it like an idiot. Every single time he starts his truck he lets it sit there idling forever. Like most instances the truck idles so long that it times out and turns off, then he remote starts it again for another cycle.   Idiot. 

He leaves for work at 4am. Home by like noon every day. Then he spends the rest of the day going out, coming back. Going out, coming back. Never gone for more than half an hour at a  time. Usually he’s only gone for 5 or ten minutes, dropping one of his kids off somewhere, or picking his wife up from the corner. Anyway.... every single time, same thing,  idling. Doesn’t matter what time of day, or year. Winter or summer.  His exhaust literally rattles the crystal in my dining room and pictures in my living room. I want to murder him. So does my wife. But we can’t do that. Trying to be nice and civil and not argue. 

He also has an 80s Cutlass that is his pride and joy. It’s literally worth $800. His brakes failed last year and he smashed the front end. Insurance wrote it off and he bought it back for like $600.  He’s that kind of idiot. He stores the Cutlass in one of those tarp tent garages. He has two of them, right on the edge of our properties. They don’t last long. Since I’ve lived here (7 years) he’s gone through about 8 of them because they keep getting wrecked in one way or another. One time the tent garage flipped over his fence onto my new van because it wasn’t secured. Insurance was involved.  A couple other times they’ve blown down the road. He’s that kind of idiot people. I can’t even explain. 

I just realized this post got long. I want to get back at him in some way that he won’t know it’s me. My best idea is to somehow disable his remote starter. He’s too dumb to ever fix it. Or like another remote to turn it off once he’s started it, but that’s probably not possible. 

I’ve tried to be nice and said things like ‘Man, my walls are rattling’ and he laughs like a thick skulled idiot and that’s it. I don’t even want to talk to him anymore, he’s so dumb. 

So reddit. What can I do? Once I pissed on the gas cap of his car while I was drinking. My wife and I like to laugh at our security cam clip of that one.

For background, I work in a very competitive part of the service industry. It's a large enough community, but at the same time it's small enough where someone somewhere in the industry knows you, so it's important to not burn Bridges as one day you might find yourself In a disadvantageous position. 

I was in my position for a good 3 years as middle management, no call outs, never late, always stayed after to help my team out, worked on projects that belonged to my bosses, etc. Except for ONE DAY which I had gotten in a car accident (I was working the night shift and it was raining, this is important later in the story) and was unable to go into work as my car was undrivable and I had to wait for tow truck, insurance, and trying to find a ride late night/early morning was very difficult.  

At the time, my director had been let go and there was a blood bath, pissing contest to see who would get his promotion. For heiriarchy purposes it's my director, my direct bosses all on same level of authority (3 of them) then me. One of the direct bosses (let's call him DB) decided he was getting the promotion and started shaking our department. Restructuring projects, changing people's shifts, taking credit for other people's work, he was a real pain. 

About a few weeks of this, he had decided to switch me from morning shifts (which I had gotten due to my seniority in the team) into night shifts. I didn't make a stink because we were very short handed (also important) and the team needed help as we had newer members who had children, and I understood how this could affect their life. Fast forward a few more weeks and I get into the car accident which made me call out. This didn't sit well with him as I had made the team suffer because of my irresponsibility (lol what?). I didn't think much of it since I knew it was stressful and people tend to say things they don't mean under stress. 

Soon after that I met some higher ups from another department, they offered me a job in a new venture the business was exploring. I was a good candidate because of my experience and work traits. Of course I agreed as this would be a promotion in position and salary, plus my network of contacts would put me in a position to grow even further. I went through a series of interviews (3 in total) and I was given the opportunity to take the position, I signed my paperwork and shook the hand. 

A couple of days later HR called me saying the position was rescinded, and that it shouldn't come as a surprise. I was shocked and asked for a meeting to understand the decision. 

Queue the day of the meeting, I walked in and HR is sitting in the meeting room with DB. After the cordialities, DB explains that he blocked my promotion because I had attendance issues (which I had one call out due to my accident) and HR chimed in saying this shouldn't deter me from applying again in 6 months (lol ok). I accepted defeat because I still needed my job, and I didn't want to paint a Target on my back. 

A couple of days later a friend of mine that worked close to DB had told me DB had made the comment that he didn't want to let me go because I would leave the night shift uncovered, and no one would easily accept that shift. I was furious, but decided to not act on it, as I explained earlier it's a small enough business. 

A few months later the competition opened up close enough that a few people left to go there. I was one of them, I was hired by an amazing boss who I am still friends with years after. He offered me a great position and a huge raise in salary. For heiriarchy purposes it was my boss then me and my counterpart then our assistants. 

I had heard through the grapevine that DB had gotten rejected from the director position and was leaving the company. About a week or so later I was looking at new hires with my boss to fill out my counterpart position. My boss calls me and says, hey look this guy comes from the company you came from. To my delight I saw DB's name. I had been hiring people to the assistant positions from previous company, so I guess DB thought he was next. 

I told my boss the story about DB and how he blocked my promotion. All my boss said was TBNT (thank you but no thank you). We didn't even give him an interview. Looking back at it, we should have given him the interview and just said no, it would have made it sweeter.

I don't know if I did it right!

So this is a throw-away account because people may start their deduction magic and know personal info if I share this from main account. TL;DR at the bottom.

A little introduction: I am a web developer with CS and marketing degrees, and I was a CEO of a medium-large company for a good period in the early 2010s. These days, with money not a problem, and my previous experience, I pick and choose my clients and provide strategic planning, growth advice, and sometimes even lead web dev projects.

In early September, I was introduced by an acquaintance to a promising little SAAS company/startup. I did some research and was impressed with their work and product.

Their problem was that since about one and a half years they've been stuck. Same products, same growth, same employees. Everything was stagnant and the company was running out of time with their investors, and tension was coming through between the founders. It was still profitable, but it has plateaued and everyone was cranky and a bit tense. 

I thought it's not a good pay but they seemed like decent people, plus it's a good opportunity to meet some innovative pople and maybe, who knows, I invest in it myself.

We first met in November, where I introduced myself and jumped straight in. I did not waste any fucking time at all. I ran a 1 hour presentation I had prepared with all my own research, about what I think is wrong and needed to change. I pointed out flaws in the structure of their website, the structure of the organization, problems with marketing, flaws in SEO, hell even security flaws.

They were so impressed they basically told me just tell us the number. 

This would seem like a perfect outcome of the introduction, but since I have been in this exact situation before, and dealt with people like that before (unofficial, TELL US THE NUMBER MESSIAH type people), an alarm rang in my brain.

I took the initiative, and asked for a 3 month trial period only. I also told them I will not be making any type of work, answering any calls related to work, or offering any advice before we document our agreement with a legally binding contract. I don't think they liked that.

After a couple of weeks of trying to act like the contract thing did not exist (2nd alarm bell), they finally provided a minimal contract after I explicitly asked what happened regarding the contract. It was obviously written on the same day by one of the founders (3rd alarm bell) but hey, it says what I wanted it to say, so whatever. I signed the contract and we got to work.

I go full in, and I mean that. I really liked the project. I layed out a 3-month plan, with each month clearly laid out and detailed. And I explained that unless month 1 was done, we cannot move on to month 2 and 3 because each month's plan depends on the previous.

For example, they did not even have in their CRM a way to track the effectiveness of sales employees or marketing campaigns. Even their god-damned Google campaigns did not have conversion tracking. So, how the hell can we start a webinar marketing campaign if you can't know how much income it made you after the spend? You know? You just can't skip month 1.

You probably expect what happened now. I deliver the plan, tell them I'm available for questions/help, and go back home (about 600 miles away). I show up a month later (we agreed to meet physically once a month), and literally just the most basic shit was done. They hadn't sent many emails, and I asked 3-4 times during this month about how work was progressing, and I was assured it's going swimmingly fast.

When I see that, having wasted an entire day of driving, I go ballistic. I tell them in no uncertain terms that they need to get their shit toegether if they want everyone here to still have a job in 4-5 months when the investor finally gets bored with their incompetence, and go home.

Now, since this obviously means our 3-month plan will not be finished in 3 months, I told them - out of good faith - and to not be a burden on the same system I'm trying to make more efficient, that I will NOT be requring any payment for December, eventhough I am still available with all my resources to their use, even visit them if required. This also means the 3-month trial will be evaulated in February, instead of January.

This time, having learned what type of people I'm dealing with, I ask for permission to be directly responsible for implementation of the changes, this means direct authority over devs and designers. Permission granted.

We start good work for about 2 weeks, before devs suddenly stop replying on Whatsapp. I call the founders and they literally tell me: ""Listen, some of the stuff you ask is just a waste of time for our devs, we do things because of your CV, but we are not sure it needs to be done"".

For the web devs here, here are some of the things they say are stupid:

* Not having the server literally in the founders house
* If you are stupid enough to do #1, not having Cloudflare to hide your IP and protect agains DDOS
* Website not indexable by Google because dev did not fix the Angular indexing issues
* Site is https, but hey it just works if you remove the S
* CRM not ip restricted, is suspicable to SQL injection!

At this point, I started to zoom out and think if this shit is worth it. They're clearly not going anywhere with this type of mentality. Actually, I wondered just how the hell did they survive yet.

I told them, as per the contract I managed to get them to burp out, that I wll not be continuting my work. So, pretty please pay me for November only (8,000 USD) and let's be done with it. 

Founder #1 stopped showing read receits on Whatsapp after this message.

Founder #2 was called several times, and finally responsed on Jan 22nd, telling me that ""their accountant did not pay quarterly taxes so their account is frozen, and payment can only be made after"". He disappeared after, but what he did not know was that founder#3 had already told me that ""since one of their employees had a car accident that is not covered by insurance, the company had to chip in wih $40,000 to bail him out, and so it's difficult at the moment. Your payment will be in your bank by Feb 1, 100%"". Founder #3 has since also disappeared.

It was obviously all bullshit, and they had no intention of paying. Even one of the good devs called me and told me they're bluffing and they look at my messages on their Whatsapp in their office, show it to each other and start laughing at me for asking to be paid since I have obviously ""done nothing"".

Anyway, since I was assured that the payment would be paid by the 1st of February, and the call is recorded, I stopped contacting because it was obvious that I'm going to sue and win. 

This is quite a predictable post isn't it. You know what happens on Feb1, and 2nd, and 3rd? Nothing. Nothing happened. So, you guessd it, I sued.

What I did not expect myself, is that my lawyer is quite the Redditor. He told me ""Are you stupid or what you daft prick?"" (happens to be my friend as well).

""What?"" I asked

""Why in the holy fuck are you suing for $8,000 only, don't you want to make them pay the asshole tax?""

""Sure thing, buddy"" - me

So we sued for:

1. $8,000 for November
2. $8,000 For December
3. $4,645 for the partial part of January
4. Late fees, legal costs, compensation fees, and hurt feelings (don't know how to translate this one but trust me it's a real law)

The suckrs called me within 15 minutes of delivering the letter, after not replying for a month. They begged me to accept $8,000 and told me it was just a money problem at the company. I asked them to speak to my lawyer only, since I don't want to say something stupid.

He takes no shit from anyone, and told them just get a lawyer and see you in small claims court. They continued their douchebaggery by not actually showing up to court. Judge ordered them to pay $34,145, which I now have half in my account, and the other half in a ""golden cheque"". I don't know how it's called in the USA, but this never bounces, as long as you cash it on the specified time.

What is most satisfying is that since the last time we spoke, on Jan 22nd, I haven't heard a single thing from them. Not a whisper. So not only did I get my money, I did not have to see or deal with these assholes again.

TLDR at the end.

A while back I met a guy on Tinder named ""Q"", and I feel in love HARD. We had everything in common, we had good families and good ideals. Sex was great, and I really saw myself going long-term with this one. He texted me every day, multiple times a day. We were constantly talking about everything under the sun. 

... but 4 months passed, and he shockingly breaks up with me for being ""too gay"". I am pretty feminine-acting, and so is he. But he also told me **""I want someone who is 6'3, Super Manly, and Super Muscular.... you will never be any of those things... so I want to end it.""**

I am crushed. The next few months I decide to stay friends, we still text every day. He did a LOT of shit that was very much in the vein of ""leading me on"" for a few months. Example: He brings me to a dinner-dance to which I am SO HOPEFUL that he will get back with me. He kissed me at the end of the night, but told me ""Oh... the scenario just felt right, and it was cute and picturesque for me... but I have no feelings for you still."" I go home, and just ghost him. We dont talk for another 5 months. 

After 6 months, he messages me, saying ""I am so wrong, you were so good for me, I want to try again."" I was head over heels, so I said yes. Things are great again for 3 months, he asks to be ""official"", and I say yes.... life is good.

**NOW HERE's WHERE ITS FUN:**

I go to the mall to buy him a Christmas gift. I see him in the mall with another man. They dont have close body language. I take a photo from a distance and send it to him, saying I got it from a friend who worked in the mall. He comes to my house immediately saying, ""Oh, its just an old co-worker I wanna catch up with...no need to worry!""   I said fine.... but I knew it wasnt right.

The next week, he comes over, and breaks up with me. I asked if the guy in the mall was an co-worker, he said ""No, it was a date....but that date was terrible so I lied to cover it up.... but there is a SECOND guy who I've been seeing for a month and Im leaving you for him."" We break up, and I never talk to him again.

Two months later, I match with a guy named ""B"" on tinder. We go on a first date, I mentioned where I worked, and later at night, he texts me, ""We need to talk.... I used to date ... I lurked your instagram and saw an old photo of you two.""  We compared timelines, and it turns out, ""Q"" actually LEFT me for ""B"".   ""B"" Later tells me he broke it off with ""Q"" after dating for 3 weeks because there was no chemistry, they had nothing in common, and found ""Q"" to be super controlling and weird. ""Q"" texted ""B"" for a month after ""B"" ended it, because ""B"" is very much hot. Tall, muscular, manly, educated .... everything ""Q"" wanted in a man. ""Q"" was begging for ""B"" to come back and try again with him. ""B"" blocked him after a few weeks.

... anyway, fast forward 3 years, me and ""B"" are still dating. We have a house, and a dog, and just appeared in a Canadian wedding magazine together. The ultimate kicker?  My boyfriend, ""B"", is 6'3, super manly, and super muscular.... so I ended up with everything that ""Q"" wanted.   Its the perfect ""love/revenge"" story... but I truly am in love with ""B""... and I'm happy!

I was a law student just graduated and could not do a career as I hoped. I also had to give her a lot of money as ""moral damages"". All my savings basically.

I will move with my cellphone home so that my position won't be tracked in their place. I will use clothes I never use and leave my car far from her place in case there were cameras. 
I will use a hat and eyeglasses to cover my face in case of cameras or testimonies. There will be no proof that it was actually me.
I will start with small things like leaving in her garden small dolls with face painted like this :( or red eyes... Something creepy. Then I will leave other creepy messages like ""I am always watching you"" (even if that is not true). I will always be very cautious and my words will be general. No proof will be against me. If asked... I was home sleeping. If they will place some cameras they will see a guy covered with clothes I do not have at home.
Then I will follow her and scratch her car, cut her tires and this several times. I paid her 25k euros so she has plenty of money to fix them.
Then the big final... I will go to her door in the night, completely covered with a dark cloth, ring her door bell and since she has the window of her bedroom facing the door street she will look through it and see a bit black figure with raised hand with finger pointed.
Then I put that finger on my throat and leave a note saying ""I will take you, torture you and kill you burning you alive in a big oven i prepared just for you, one day: enjoy the waiting. Wherever you go I will be there"". I know it is gross and creepy and that is just what I want. 
Then I will leave as fast as I can, drop the black cloth in some trash nearby  and just leave the place walking. When police will come, if she called it, I will be far.
So she will live the rest of her life in fear. As she said she was, lying... Scared for her life. Now she will have a real reason to.
Maybe she will think about me  but she will have no proves at all that it was me and you know... Without proves you cannot do much.  In the end, world is full of creeps, he could be another man. Or an ex boyfriend or whatever.

This story goes through on a lifetime and it took a long time for me to put together all the pieces.

The cast:

Me and my mom 

MF: my childhood friend

MFF: my friend's father

Richard: the thief (not his real name)

So long time ago when I was just a little kid, my mom was in a pretty tough situation. 

She divorced and had to take care of me, my older brother, and my litte brother (who is autistic, therefore he needed special treatment). My father didn't leave us, but the divorce was so fresh and painful that he refused to help my mom, but he took care of us, the kids. It was a weird situation, because my mom got custody but she didn't want any of my fathers money, therefore she didn't get much alimony.

Long story short: my father made a decent living, my mother was poor (of course my father was always fighting for costudy but that’s a story for another subreddit).

Anyway, at the time my mom had a little store in a small town selling sewing machines, but mostly used gadgets. She bought and sold stuff to make a living and if you want to make money on that market, you have to make bargains with all kind of people, including the kind of people who you don't even want to contact in real life if you are a sane person. 

This is where Richard comes into the picture. He was a petty thief and a drug addict, who always wanted to sell stuff to my mum (yes, probably some of it was stolen, never asked my mom whether she bought something from him ever. I like to belive she hasn’t, as I never saw police officers in the store). So one time my mom was picking out the cash from the cashier to take it to the bank, when Richard comes in to ask some questions. He took a good opportunity to steal my moms wallet and her phone. My mom didn't press charges because she didn’t have money for a lawyer, but she managed to get back some of the money and her phone, but she lost at least 1600 dollar worth of money. Needless to say, it was a really big shock for our family. But because we were just little kids, we didn't know about this at that time.

Time went by, and I'm going to high school and two things happened. First of all MF's house got completely destroyed. You know, MFF had this thing called ’re-cycling’ money. He always borrowed and lent money and I think that time he was late with repayment, so one of the guys he owed hired some other dude to destroy his house as revenge. Guess who was the lucky guy who got the job… That’s right, it was Richard! He never got caught by the police in this case, but he payed too many visits in MFFs hamburger restaurant asking questions about the invastigation. After some time, it was so obvious that this idiot did it, but there was not enough evidence to prove it. But this time, he got a biiiig enemy and it didn't take a long time to unveil Richard’s drug businesses. So, eventually he turned out to be a stupid petty criminal and got 8 years in prison for not even the worst thing he has ever done. MFF had a contact, who had a contact in prison who wrote letters every month about the guys in local businesses who got caught and sent behind bars. This will be important later.

The second thing that happened, my mom got a new husband. A husband, who, by chance, worked in prison as the wise chief physician. And because my mom has attented nursing school long ago (hasn't finished it because of the marriage to my father) my new stepfather got her a new job in the prison’s medical department.

By this point, Richard almost completely lost all his mind because of the drugs (yes, he was still on drugs, even in prison) and couldn't even recognise my mom. I mean... he could, but not quite. For some reason, he tought she was her doctor, back in the town! He said big hellos to her and told her things like ""Hey Doctor! Doctor! Do you recognise me? I was your patient in town!!"" etc. At one point, my mom lost it, looked around, and the next conversation unfolded:

\- Richard shut up! I was not your doctor! I was never a doctor! You know me because one time you robbed me!

\- But... no... no I never...

\- Yes you did! Now shut up, and go back to your place!

Richard was in shock, so he just looked down to the floor and obeyed. Now, there is one important rule in the prison: be friends with everyone in the medical department, because they have all the medicine and drugs! Two really big guys heard the conversation, so they went to my mom and asked her:

\- Should we... you know... reward him?

My mom looked around. No guards nearby. She quietly answered:

\- You should...  but, just a little. \*winks\*

The two guys nodded, and when the guards came back, these two stood around Richard as they all left the medical department.

Do you remeber the letter thing? Well, a little time passed, and Richard’s name came up somehow in a conversation between me and MF. He told me this:

\- Something has happened to him in prison. My father said that in those letters there has been just one sentence about Richard in the past few months: ""He stretches nicely"".

…Well, for now I have a pretty good guess what happened to him… :D",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,929385,public,self,"Sooo, I'm posting this the third time.

I had just joined a new charter school for my Sophomore year, I had just turned 15 at the time and I was new to my High School and one of my classes for the new school year was Spanish. Now, as a Mexican, I am ashamed to not know Spanish so I took the class to help myself communicate with my family. Our Spanish teacher was a nice, old woman and we shall call her Mrs. Sanchez for protective reasons. She had been born in South America and was a native Spanish speaker but had moved to America to get her teaching degree. For the first week, she had been a pretty nice old lady. She was fun, a bit hard to understand with her accent but fun nonetheless.

However, later on, about 2 or 3 weeks into the school year, she was teaching Spanish oddly. Some of the things that stick in my mind that she said was that the letter W wasn’t in the Spanish alphabet. (It is, it just isn’t used or pronounced in Spanish often.) Well, these things had been bothering the class for quite a while. Just across from the high school is an elementary that is part of the same district. The  elementary goes from Kindergarten to 8th grade. From there, the 8th grader can graduate and come to our high school for their 4 years of high school.

Anyway, Ms. Sanchez’s class was mainly a Freshman and Sophomore year class. Freshman and Sophomores much like me, noticed Sanchez’s incorrect way of Spanish and many of those students went to the elementary to complain. They went to the main Spanish teacher there. She was loved by practically every student there. Not only that, she was my aunt. Let's call her Mrs. Moreno. Mrs. Moreno (hailing from Mexico and a native speaker) was my aunt who taught at the elementary school. Many of her past kids complained to her but I was the one to go and burst Mrs. Sanchez's bubble. I finally complained to my mom about the Spanish I was being taught and fed up, my mom decided to talk to her sister, my aunt, Mrs. Moreno, about this.

As you can expect, to hear all these complaints and then a complaint from her nephew, Mrs. Moreno raised hell. As far as I’ve been told, Mrs. Moreno didn’t want to waste any time with dealing with a faulty teacher. From what I know, Mrs. Moreno went and complained to the Administration/Superintendents, about a teacher teaching students things completely wrong. For the entire first semester, we had to deal with Mrs. Sanchez, we heard her talking and teaching us all wrong but I had known it was a matter of time before she was gone. The rest of the class, as you can guess, was clueless of what was to come and only moaned as she taught us wrong the entire first semester.

Then, it happened. We had just released for Winter Break. 2 weeks of no school and us just kicking back and enjoying our holiday season. I dreaded the first day going back but something was up. We, the students had walked into that class only to notice things missing. There were masses of items that were gone that had belonged to Mrs. Sanchez, the class was practically barren. We had a sub that day. And the next day. Until on the 3rd after we returned, I questioned my mom. That was when she laid it all out for me. Mrs. Moreno had gotten Ms. Sanchez fired with all of her complaints. Had the students kept complaining, my aunt said she would just thought Ms. Sanchez was hard on the students. It wasn’t until I made my complaint of what she was doing wrong that my aunt took action. I single-handedly got a teacher fired because of my complaint. I’m 17 now and sometimes I wonder Sanchez is doing nowadays. I wonder if she got her teaching license revoked.

This story goes through on a lifetime and it took a long time for me to put together all the pieces.

So long time ago when I was just a little kid, my mom was in a pretty tough situation.

She divorced and had to take care of me, my older brother, and my litte brother (who is autistic, therefore he needed special treatment). My father didn't leave us, but the divorce was so fresh and painful that he refused to help my mom, but he took care of us, the kids. It was a weird situation, because my mom got custody but she didn't want any of my fathers money, therefore she didn't get much alimony.

Long story short: my father made a decent living, my mother was poor (of course my father was always fighting for costudy but that’s a story for another subreddit).

Anyway, at the time my mom had a little store in a small town selling sewing machines, but mostly used gadgets. She bought and sold stuff to make a living and if you want to make money on that market, you have to make bargains with all kind of people, including the kind of people who you don't even want to contact in real life if you are a sane person.

This is where Richard comes into the picture(not his real name). He was a petty thief and a drug addict, who always wanted to sell stuff to my mum (yes, probably some of it was stolen, never asked my mom whether she bought something from him ever. I like to belive she hasn’t, as I never saw police officers in the store). So one time my mom was picking out the cash from the cashier to take it to the bank, when Richard comes in to ask some questions. He took a good opportunity to steal my moms wallet and her phone. My mom didn't press charges because she didn’t have money for a lawyer, but she managed to get back some of the money and her phone, but she lost at least 1600 dollar worth of money. Needless to say, it was a really big shock for our family. But because we were just little kids, we didn't know about this at that time.

Time went by, and I'm going to high school and two things happened. First of all, my best friend's house got completely destroyed. You know, his father had this thing called ’re-cycling’ money. He always borrowed and lent money and I think that time he was late with repayment, so one of the guys he owed hired some other dude to destroy his house as revenge. Guess who was the lucky guy who got the job… That’s right, it was Richard! He never got caught by the police in this case, but he payed too many visits in my friend's father's hamburger restaurant asking questions about the invastigation. After some time, it was so obvious that this idiot did it, but there was not enough evidence to prove it. But this time, he got a biiiig enemy and it didn't take a long time to unveil Richard’s drug businesses. So, eventually he turned out to be a stupid petty criminal and got 8 years in prison for not even the worst thing he has ever done. MFF had a contact, who had a contact in prison who wrote letters every month about the guys in local businesses who got caught and sent behind bars. This will be important later.

The second thing that happened, my mom got a new husband. A husband, who, by chance, worked in prison as the wise chief physician. And because my mom has attented nursing school long ago (hasn't finished it because of the marriage to my father) my new stepfather got her a new job in the prison’s medical department.

By this point, Richard almost completely lost all his mind because of the drugs (yes, he was still on drugs, even in prison) and couldn't even recognise my mom. I mean... he could, but not quite. For some reason, he tought she was her doctor, back in the town! He said big hellos to her and told her things like ""Hey Doctor! Doctor! Do you recognise me? I was your patient in town!!"" etc. At one point, my mom lost it, looked around, and the next conversation unfolded:

\- Richard shut up! I was not your doctor! I was never a doctor! You know me because one time you robbed me!

\- But... no... no I never...

\- Yes you did! Now shut up, and go back to your place!

Richard was in shock, so he just looked down to the floor and obeyed. Now, there is one important rule in the prison: be friends with everyone in the medical department, because they have all the medicine and drugs! Two really big guys heard the conversation, so they went to my mom and asked her:

\- Should we... you know... reward him?

My mom looked around. No guards nearby. She quietly answered:

\- You should... but, just a little. \*winks\*

The two guys nodded, and when the guards came back, these two stood around Richard as they all left the medical department.

Do you remeber the letter thing? Well, a little time passed, and Richard’s name came up somehow in a conversation between me and my friend. He told me this:

\- Something has happened to him in prison. My father said that in those letters there has been just one sentence about Richard in the past few months: ""He stretches nicely"".

On mobile, sorry about formatting and English isn't my first language. 

Backstory, I was friends with this guy. For the sake of privacy we'll call him Josh. Josh was weird, he really liked feet. I didn't really care 'cause he can like whatever he wants. Josh also really REALLY liked attention, prefferably bad attention. He LOVED it when people leaked stuff of his, let people break in on his instagram and made them leak things for ""revenge"" (discovered that quite late). There was a whole app group for people that didn't like him. He hurted a lot of people, mostly girls. (I am female aswell) 

Now to the story. 
I was chilling in my living room when I get a text from Josh. He tells me he used me and never liked me. I was very mad since I was always there caring for Josh. He told me that I could take revenge on him. He had send me nudes in the past and knew I had some ""dirt"" on him. 
He send me his log in on insta, but I did something else than he wanted. Instead of humiliating him, giving him the attention he wanted, I permanently deleted his insta account. He was PISSED. He told me he never meant what he said and just wanted me to do that for his own pleasure. I got even madder and told him he could suck his toe. 

I went into the app group of people that didn't like him, told him what I did and they where in on it. 
Since John didn't learn from his mistake, he kept sending his log in to people that disliked him. We all deleted his accounts. Account popped up, account got deleted and so on.

Yes, I know I’m a shitty person. Also, this is gonna be a long one.

When I was around 6 or 7, I made a friend with a kid that lived right next to me. Let’s call him Drake. Drake was a super nice kid and we would hang out all the time in the summer whenever he would go to his grandparents house (His grandparents house and my house were connected through backyards). Everything was great for a while until I learned just how bad his family life was and why he would stay at his grandparents. His dad was in and out of jail due to being in a gang and his mom constantly OD’d on sleeping pills so he would have to stay at his grandparents due to a lack of parenting. Despite this, D was a very kind and energetic kid. That was, till about 4th grade. He all of a sudden started doing things that were extremely alarming for a fourth grader to be doing such as smoking cigarettes and swearing every other sentence even in front of adults. Due to this, my parents wouldn’t allow me to hang out with him anymore so the only time I would talk to him was at school. We stayed decent friends through middle school, stopping to talk with each other every now and then. That is, until 9th grade. I was an idiot freshman and wanted to get a vape because everybody was getting one. He offered to sell me his for 40 dollars (I later found out it was only worth about 20 dollars) which I happily accepted since I trusted him. He took my money and left. At first, I thought he was just going to go get it so I waited there for a bit until it was obvious that he wasn’t coming back. I was confused and really nervous because this was all in school and I was scared he got caught. I kept dismissing the idea that he stole the money because I didn’t want to believe that he was following in his dad’s footsteps. I walk around until I find him in the bathroom and ask if he has it to which he responds with “I don’t know what you talkin’ about”. I told him that he still had to give me the vape. what happened next made my heart sink. He got right up in my face and said “You better stop right there before I silence you myself”. I was pretty devastated. He just threatened to beat me up over 40 fucking dollars. I wish that was the end of it but that was only the begining. Over the course of the next 3 years he would get up in my face and threaten to beat the shit out of me when there wasn’t anyone around but his deadbeat friends. He even threw a glass bottle at my head one time which hit me in the back of the head and left a big welt. I didn’t say a thing because he both owned a gun (illegally), knew where I lived, and for some dumb reason I didn’t want to snitch on him because I felt bad for him. That was, until last year.  At this point, I am a Senior in high school and I was stopping by the nearest gas station because I needed a phone charger. Turns out Drake works at that gas station and when I walk in, he instantly starts accusing me of things I didn’t do in order to atart something with me so I start trying to leave. Him and his Goon of a friend follow me out and start taking practice swings at my while I’m calmly walking back to my car. As I climb in, they spit on my car and start hitting it. That was it. I was gonna hurt this kid. So I waited. I waited and waited until the chance came frolicking into my arms. The day I was sick from school. Something huge happened at our school. His sister got stabbed four times in the middle of the hallway (shes okay now). This was my chance. I spent over 3 hours asking around until someone sent me the video of the whole thing. I posted it on R/holdmyfeedingtube and in under 24 hours, it had 10,000 upvotes. I watched as people made fun of his sister in the comments and smiled.

To the mid-1950s in fact. My father's office was right across the street from my school, and because his regular hours meshed well with my school hours I usually rode with him in the mornings, rather than take the bus.  One morning there was a pep rally or some such event in front of the school, as we approached from the rear. An arrogant stupid cop (ASC) was blocking the street on the side of the school when my father tried to make a turn to reach his parking lot.  ASC told him to take it around the block. My father explained that he was just going to the parking lot about half way down the street, well away from the crowd in front of the school. ASC repeated ""Take it on around the block."" Soon after I left the car and from then on this account is from my father. He drove around several blocks and eventually reached his reserved parking space via an alley on the other side of the blocked street. This is where ASC made his stupid mistake.  Seeing my father pulling into his parking space ASC walked across the street and told my father, ""Listen, Buddy, when I tell you to do something, you do it."" This jerk should have considered the fact that the building across from the school was the Federal Building and that you might think twice about verbally assaulting someone with a reserved space in the Federal Building parking lot. My father was a treasury agent. In fact he was in charge of collections for the IRS in a large area in the northwest corner of the state. In practice his badge trumped the cop's badge by a couple orders of magnitude. A subsequent investigation revealed that ASC, like many law officers, took private security gigs during off duty hours.  Wonder of wonder not a penny of that income was ever reported.  That's tax evasion, a federal felony, the same thing they got Al Capone on. I doubt that ASC ever served prison time, but he sure got a hefty bill for unpaid taxes, plus penalty and interest.

Hope it is pro enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I live in an area with lots of parking issues. There is always something going on and parking can be very tight. I happen to have a house with a large parking lot where we can fit 6-8 cars and lots of friends come to park at my house when there are events going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I happened to be out running errands while one such event was going on. Came home to my house and found a mini van parking in what could be two spots (I have a truck and could park kind of up a slight embankment if the mini van hadnt parked about 4 feet away from the car to its right.) Thinking this is probably one of my wifes friends I just park behind the van and my wifes vehicle (also blocking in 2 other vehicles I recognized) and take off for the event to meet everyone (errand I was running was to get the finals things for a big group dinner.) 

&amp;#x200B;

A while later one of my buddies and I walk back home to get the grill started for dinner and see a big tow truck in my driveway. As I am walking up this totally pissed off dude is yelling at the tow truck driver and I walk up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Whats going on here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tow truck guy: Is this your house? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: Why in the fuck did you park me in? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Because this is my house and I can park wherever the hell I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No this is NOT your house. I am good friends with (old owner) and he said I could park here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tow truck driver: Can I leave? This guy said a car was blocking him in at his house but cannot show me proof that he lives here. And sir? (to pissed off guy) We have your credit card number and will be charging a fee to come over here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No way are you going to be charging me. This guy is blocking me in on my friends property. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: When did you talk to your friend and ask him if you could park here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: I called him last night and let him know I was coming up here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Did you talk to him in person? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No I left him a message. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Oh.....so he couldnt have told you that I bought this house from him almost 6 years ago. I guess you guys are really good buddies huh? To the tow truck guy: You are good to leave. (and he goes back to his truck.) So I guess you are pretty fucked now huh? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: Fuck you!! Move your car or I am calling the cops!! Our wives are waiting for us to pick them and our kids up. (Hadnt noticed that another guy got out of the van.)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: No. (Buddy walks over and hands me a beer.) I will move my truck when I feel like it. You parked on my property. No one can get me to move my vehicle if I dont want to. (I walk over to start the grill and talk to my buddy while listening to how much of a f\*cking A$$hole I am.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Sane friend walks over: Hey. Can I pay you a parking fee or something and get you to move your car? Sorry he is being such an ahole.....he's my brother in law so unfortunately family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Fine. Give me $100 and you can get out of here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guy opens wallet and hands me $100 and I throw my buddy keys to move my truck so they can get out. Now why did I have him move it? I was busy calling another buddy.....who was a cop just stationed down the road from me. Called and filled him in and he came right around the corner from my house (where he couldnt be seen) and I went out to antagonize the jerk again. Still yelling as he pulled out onto the public road.....oops!!

&amp;#x200B;

Cop walks over and flags him down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cop: What seems to be the problem.....sir am I smelling alcohol on your breath? 

&amp;#x200B;

Blew over and was cuffed and put in the back of a patrol car. His BIL blew, was sober and was allowed to take the mini van but before he left he walked up to me and said: I thought you gave up way too easy. You made this happen didnt you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Maaaybe. Do you think it will teach him to be less of an asshole when he is the one in the wrong?

Some backstory: He’s 79 and kicking but isn’t in the best shape anymore. He was drafted into the army while in highschool and then enlisted in the  navy afterwards. Before I was born he was honorably discharged, and until I was about two he was getting a criminal justice degree, and then went on to be the sheriff of the county he lives in. He retired probably 4-6 years ago. My grandma also worked in the army (she had a desk job, I don’t know the specifics) and retired three years before my grandpa did. So they make a decent amount in pensions (not a lot, but enough to pay taxes on the house that’s been in my grandma’s family for a few generations, and enough to spoil us grandkids when we come visit, as grandparents do). It will be important to note, later in the story, that I have an uncle who lives in the same town as my grandpa and is currently a deputy for the police department. 

Anyways, on to the story. So maybe four years ago (I was just fourteen) my grandpa decided he wanted a shed. He’s a big wood-working guy, and makes benches and bookshelf’s and nightstands etc. etc. in his free time, but he isn’t in shape to build a structure even with the help of my cousins. So he decided to hire this guy, who we’ll call John. He liked hiring local, and this guy was from the small town my grandpa was from and still lives in. When my grandpa hires john(in winter) he says he’ll start construction at the beginning of spring (where we live, this is usually when the weather allows, as it snows well into “spring” some years) and he’ll have the construction done by the end of fall. He gives my grandpa a quote (I don’t know the amount exactly). My grandpa is excited to have a little work shop of his own (and so is my grandma because she doesn’t like all the noise the saws and drills make when he works in the basement). Spring rolls around, and John doesn’t show. My grandpa already had to pay a small portion upfront, so he’s a little pissed, and calls John to ask where he is. John says he got another contracting project out of town and it will be a bit before he can get to my grandfathers shed. 
He didn’t come until October. 
Due to the weather in the state I live in, that meant construction couldn’t really start. He got the foundation down, and that was it. My grandpa is a little pissed but understands, hey, this local guy got a big gig, not a big deal. 
It takes this guy three years to finish the shed. So my grandpa’s pissed, understandably, but doesn’t say anything to John. He pays John what John quoted him, plus additional costs because of the time it took. But he calls the company that gave John a contracting permit to file an official report against him (I don’t know how this works and I might be getting this part wrong). It goes without a hitch, he thinks it’s over, right? 
Wrong.

On my cousin’s graduation that year, John, uninvited, shows up and tells my grandpa he still owes 6k, my grandpa basically told him to come back on a different day because my cousin is more important. 
That night he got an email from John’s lawyer. It was something along the lines of 
“You still owe John and johns wife (let’s call her jill) 6k that hasn’t been paid.” 
My grandpa responds with “send me an invoice.” He instantly got in touch with his lawyer. 
He doesn’t get an electronic invoice, but two days later gets a letter on his doorstep with a note inside signed by Jill saying “you still owe 6k,” with the original quote attached, but the cost whited out so there was an additional nearly 10k added. 
So he sends the original copy of the quote, along with the letter from Jill, as well as a printed copy of the email from John and Jill’s lawyer, to his lawyer, and talks to my uncle (we’ll call him Dave).
So Dave starts asking people offhand about John, and starts bringing John up to his work friends, before finding out that a few years prior John had been reported for theft, but the case hadn’t went anywhere. Dave digs a little and finds more and more police reports saying that John has repeatedly stolen from people around the town, as well as failed to pay the teens he hires over summer (the pd couldn’t deal with this so that’s why no arrests had been made, as they’re all matters that need to be settled in court). Dave starts making a small file full of copies of the reports. 
Meanwhile my grandpas lawyer is trying to sort out this issue with out my grandpa needing to go to court. My grandpa gets a “discount” that lowers the 6k still owed to about 4.5k, but my grandpa is still livid. And after taking to Dave, he decides he’s going to take it to court. 
My grandpa goes to court with his lawyer, and has both the small packet from Dave as well as his own records. I wasn’t there for the trial so I cant say exactly what happened, but Dave had to pay out 10k plus some to my grandpa, as well as numerous other fees to various other clients and employees, had to do community service work (I don’t remember how much), and got his contracting license permanently revoked. Last I heard from John and Jill had moved out of the county, and John was working as a cashier somewhere due to the fact that he couldn’t become a contractor and hadn’t gone to school for anything else. 
Since then he’s found some sketchy spots in the structure, but nothing major, so with the help of my oldest cousin (19) they can usually fix the problems before they get bad.

My mom is living proof, especially since she's not a really a vengeance minded person (I am, but I don't get that from her). That said, my mom's tough. She's had to put up with a lot of shit over the years, particularly from some breathtakingly shitty men, one of whom I have to share half my genetics with. So if you're interested, here's the story of how my parents' divorce turned out.

My dad's a dick and has always been threatened by any success or indication that my mom might be better than him at something. They used to have a business together and she was the one that got everybody paid. That bruised his ego. After two kids, two moves, and several years of him behaving like an apocalyptic fuckhat, my parents separate and later divorce. Unfortunately, my petty tendencies came from somewhere and that somewhere was my sperm donor.

Divorce is never easy or fun, but this was about as pleasant as a barbed wire buttplug. On the legal and financial end, trying to get any cooperation or child support was like squeezing blood from a stone. For us kids, he had joint custody where he put no effort into bonding with us and mostly dumped him on his new girlfriend and eventual wife (who is ten years younger than him). She's an unholy hellbitch to me and my sibling and he can't be arsed to care too much about that. To make things extra miserable, dad and his new succubus spend a healthy amount of time telling us that our mother is evil and trying to take us away from him. And we should stop telling her anything that happens at their house. There's a lot more to unpack, but it mostly belongs under RBN or JustNoFamily.

Now where's my mother in all of this? Doing her fucking best. She does everything she can to protect me and my sibling from all this bullshit. But she can't take us away from our dad. From the court's perspective, there's nothing wrong with our dad: he's gainfully employed, has no arrest record, no addictions, and isn't physically abusing us. If she tried to take us away, the court would rule against her, seeing her as just a bitter ex-wife trying to fuck over her ex. And me and my sibling were pretty brainwashed at this point; if she tried to tell us what our dad was doing was wrong, we would have just seen this as proof that all the horrible things our dad had been telling us were true. So my mom did her best to take the high road and support us through the worst years of our lives.

Fortunately, I do take after my mom at least a little and finally stood up for myself. Shortly after I turned fourteen, I started refusing to go to my father's house. My sibling followed suit. We were old enough that the court had to take our opinions in account and couldn't force us to see our father. I have not set foot in that house for over a decade and it still remains the best decision I have ever made (which is more than I can say for most fourteen year olds - no shade, but everyone does stupid shit at that age, myself included).

No why is this my mom's revenge? Well, one of my dad's worst fears was realized without him even realizing it (not exactly difficult, he has the self-awareness of hemorrhoid): my mom is better than him. A better spouse, a better ex, a better parent, a better person, and she managed to do all this without him, in spite of him. She is the best parent I could have ever asked for and I am incredible lucky, especially since plenty of people don't even get ONE good parent. For all the misery my worthless sack of pigshit of a father dragged us through, he will never get what he really wants: my mother as a miserable failure. Deep down, he know he's lost.

My mom is much better off this days. Her kids are getting launched and her longtime boyfriend has moved in. She has a successful business, a cute dog, and a partner who buys her flowers and makes her laugh like a lunatic.

And my dad? My sibling talks to him very sporadically and I haven't spoken to the cum rag since 2013, in a phone call that involved raised voices and expletives. And he's still married to that cock-juggling thundercunt I call my stepmother. Last I heard about their relationship, she's prone to publicly berating him at work events in front all his colleagues. 

TLDR: My dad is shitty husband, a worse ex, and an equally bad father. Mom takes the high road and now he's stuck married to the hell harpy that is his second wife and neither of his kids will speak to him.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,929747,public,self,My mom is the unintentional master of pro-revenge,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/f33uid/my_mom_is_the_unintentional_master_of_prorevenge/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I had been there for quite some time and had seen many managers, both good and bad, come and go. They typically lasted just a couple of years.

We had been gifted a general manager who was sent to our store as his last chance to salvage his career and when he failed, we were without a general manager for a couple of months. The assistant managers ran the restaurant and things were ok. But no one was getting promoted within the company.

Then the district manager went with an outside hire that was coming in from the other side of the country. This guy was a complete idiot. We'll call him Johnny. He had zero experience as a general manager and wasn't even applying for the position, but the district manager talked him into taking the job. Big mistake.

Under Johnny's tutelage, our Emerald Wednesday started to slowly fail, mostly due to his mismanagement. He was belligerent to the staff, making a couple of the girls cry by belittling them in front of everyone else. He was so lazy he'd hide in the office on busy weekends while we struggled without a manager. He refused to do even the basics of his job, like the nightly pull-thaw.

For those who don't know, many things are kept frozen in the walk-in freezer and are pulled forward to the cooler at night so that they thaw before morning. This was rarely done on Johnny's evening shifts. We would routinely have to force-thaw steaks, shrimp and chicken under running cold water, which is not something that we're supposed to even do.

I saw on a few occasions that Johnny was cross-contaminating foods under the running water, a pan of frozen shrimp sitting on top of or even in a pan of frozen steaks. At one point, (I didn't see this one), Johnny ran some frozen steaks under hot water to thaw them quickly because they needed to be cooked RIGHT THEN. This was a HUGE problem and had I seen it, I'd have wanted to punch the fool in his face.

We sometimes ran checks of multiple hours and had frequent guest complaints. One guest even threw his silverware at the host. Johnny was called up front and actually took the guest's side, leaving the host in tears. I believe he even compted the guy's meal.

Johnny was a real class act. I made it my mission to do something about him. At the very least he was going to get someone very ill from his shenanigans.

So I sat down with the district manager (who had brought Johnny in), and spoke with him at length and great detail about how bad Johnny was, how terrible the morale was, how he could get people ill, all of it. He asked me point blank what I thought of Johnny and I told him ""Johnny is an idiot."" 

Nothing came of it.

Christmas was coming and I knew I was quitting in a couple of months. Johnny insisted on having a Christmas party at a bar a town away, but fraternizing between management and hourly employees was against company policy, so I didn't go. Johnny got quite drunk and drove himself home. I heard from co-workers that Johnny had been pulled over for a DUI. Oops.

A week or so later, I wrote a lengthy email detailing everything Johnny has screwed up on, wrote about the Christmas party and included screenshots of court records I was able to look up on the town's website. I set up a burner email account and messaged everyone I could find in the Emerald Wednesday hierarchy.

When I went back to work a couple days later, we had a shiny new general manager, and no one knew what I had done. I am not proud of this, but he was making lives miserable, the restaurant was failing, and I was certain he was a public health risk.

In July, my elderly neighbor had her grandson, and pregnant girlfriend, move in “to help them out”. She is a widowed lady in her seventies. Babbles a lot, but sweet.

I have a soft spot for her. Years ago, she cornered me as I was leaving to take my dog on a walk. My dog was unhappily pacing waiting for the walk while we listened to her stories. He peed on her during the story; she is so senile she didn’t notice. 

Just a few days later, I am mowing my backyard and the grandson walks past my house carrying an amazon envelope. Weird. An hour later, sweet little old lady comes over. With the envelope her grandson had. “This was in my landscaping”. 

Totally forgot I ordered my kids the movie “Leap”. (What a shit haul for this kid.)

See I am a criminal defense attorney. Probably the only one this lady knows. If I call the cops, my neighbor will try to hire me. It will get weird. She is so sweet. I will be a witness. He is on probation, so he will sit in jail for a while. This will totally make me look like a snitch to my own clients in that same jail who are thieves, addicts, and burglars. It’s bad personally and professionally. And it’s not the biggest deal. 

So I filled up an Amazon box with “purple rain powder” that was ordered to my office. A dry dye that gets darker and spreads when it comes into contact with your sweat. That lasts a week on your skin. Think leaking pen, times fifty. 

Why? I want to shame him, and it won’t come back on me. He’s not gonna call the cops for stealing my shit. He isn’t gonna tell his grandma he stole from me. And if it makes a mess in her house, it’s still cheaper for her then hiring a lawyer and paying her grandsons court costs and fines. 

Yep, package was gone in 20 minutes. 

I walk past the home; screams of anger at the pregnant girlfriend “this shit won’t come off” “it’s all over my grandmas house”. Priceless. 

The following day I give him the “head nod” as he smokes a cigarette in a hoody in July. He runs inside.

Now I am not going to hide his name because he should be proud of himself. At first me and Austin were great friends and would eat lunch together and hang out and talk about cool cartoon shows like Chowder,KND,etc.(best cartoons ever btw) and got along great but one day a new transfer student came to our school from the UK and Austin started picking on him. I was infuriated with him and told him so and he pushed me and said so what you are a loser anyway and walked off. Now I am a kind person and never get into fights so I just let him go.

A week passes and one day we are in PE running laps when I pass Austin and am now in first place. Suddenly he gained speed and pushed me into a ditch that went around the track and I landed on my arm! At first I was so angry I didn't notice it broke(probably adrenaline?) and walked out of the ditch to see all the others kids screaming and running from me. I was confused and just so happen to look down and seem my arm dangling. I start freaking out screaming and the coach comes to see whats wrong. When she sees it she has the school call 911 and I am taken to the hospital.

When I come back from the hospital a week later and participate school again Austin would make fun of me calling me a cripple and his goons would make jokes. Later that day I get called to the office and tell them about the whole incident and they talked to Austin and in the end said they couldn't do anything because the track is behind the school and to far from the camera's views and I had no evidence. I then got an idea and asked everyone who was there if they saw what happened and I asked for written statements of the event after 3 days I have 13 statements and give them to the principal who then calls the students and gives interviews after this he then calls Austin and tells him he is suspended for a week. Word eventually got around and people feared Austin and didn't go near him and for the rest of middle school he was alone not even his goons would go around as to keep there bones intact.

I make them pay money to other services but when its all said and done they will loose out of tuition paying students.

I graduated high school and I was ready for life! I applied to colleges and got accepted. I started comparing financials and it seemed that one school just made sense. I contact the VP of finance at another school that was closer to home and he promised in writing that they will match the financials as the cheaper school. 

Great! I pack my car up hop in and drive 8 hours away from my life. I get into the dorm and sit down. Im in college. My life is about to be awesome! 

Three months down the road, I get a bill for over $25k due in 10 days. Wait. My eyes got huge! “What is this bull shit” i ask myself. I immediately get on the phone with a financial counselor and explain the situation. She doesn’t know whats going on so I get bounced to another and to another and back and forth for over a year. Meanwhile the VP himself has disappeared from all of existence, but only for me. To everyone else he’s readily available. On too of it all, everyone is getting emails about how the school “accidentally” overcharged sales tax and we’re all getting a refund. Not to mention no name charges on accounts that if you ask them about what its for they will just take it off and not explain. I warned other students about this activity and it seems to be a campus wide problem. I asked alumni and they agreed that this school has a bogus financial system and they try to cheat students out of money. 

So, i make the decision that im going to make this school pay. They wont be paying me but they will be paying others. I start off with throwing cake on a campus safety vehicle. Great they’ll waste money on some guy washing that off. Whats next. I’ll smoke bomb the dorms. Get the deans all riled up and make them pay to get the smoke out of the hallway. (No residents were evacuated for that one).

What could be even better. How about turning the seal on a water pip in the middle of the night at a building and make them pay for all the emergency services that came! That cost them a good $8k. 

I could throw detergent into the fountain? Check. Another couple thousand there. 

I began to think how I can really make a bigger difference. Not only make them pay monetarily but also in public relations. I taught myself computer programming, but im a business major. At this point im only a sophomore and nobody is going to hire me to do anything really important like that! 

So i make a plan. I’ll start off with maintenance jobs, male my way up to something like a computer lab manager or a computer science TA... and then get some exposure like that! 

Fast forward 2 years of dumb jobs and kissing ass, and I get an email for a job offer. An Admin Web Developer! I was so excited! I can finally make a real dent! Maybe even a gaping hole! Maybe a huge gaping holy grail glory hole!! 

I get hired and the first day on the job i make some spelling error on the front page. Everyone panics and is calling out office left and right. I fix it eventually. Ok lets change the picture of the VP to some super old ugly dude. Done. More phone calls more PR panics. Well how about inserting a lil bug? No. I dont wanna screw others over. Lets try a redirect!? Yes! A redirect to.. 

i stop myself. I dont want to do that quite yet but in a semester when I graduate... (insert universitynamehere).edu is going to pornhub. I’ll keep you updated but so far i’ve calculated, I got the school to pay at least $20k to some other kind individuals, and about $5k on their own employees through wasted time investing and cleaning etc. Now they might loose a heck of a lot more if this institution gets redirected to a not so family friendly website.

I was driving down a small country road with a 45mph speed limit that some choose to ignore. And coming up behind me was a standard work truck (I won't name names but it was a popular automotive parts store delivery truck) and got right on my bumper I'm in not in a tiny car but it's a sedan and he was so close that all I saw was grill and hood in my mirrors. While I stayed doing the speed limit, after about 3 mins he decided that a sharp curve was the perfect time to pass me and surprise surprise there was a car coming after the curve. He swerved at me and I slammed the brakes nearly missing his bumper.

Thankfully I had this all on dashcam, front and back. I got home later and got the footage on my laptop and called their 1800 number with his plate number and his truck number. The woman I spoke to was SUPER apologetic and she asked me to send her the video. She watched it while on the line with me and immediately asked if she could put me on hold. I said yes and a few minutes go by and she gets back and brings me someone else on the line. The local store manager of that driver. She had sent him the video and the manager apologized a ton and promised me right then and there that employee was terminated for that behavior.


A few weeks go by and I don't hear anything till a friend of mine on Facebook sends me a link, the driver that was fired managed to get my name from his HR or manager or something and was trying to find me IRL because he lost his job and made a video wearing his work uniform threatening violence on me because of everything. I went to my local PD station about it and showed them the video and explained everything and was told I needed to speak to that company again because they let my name get out. I called them and told them everything going on and I was told I'd get a call from their HR department within 2-3 business days. Literally 6 hours later I received a call from some higher up HR person with one of their legal team on the phone. They wanted me to sign a document stating I won't publicly go after them or give negative PR if they Sue him for me and get restraining order and everything on this guy for what he threatened. They even offered to have a lawyer of my chosing go over it with me at no cost to me and sign it and have them handle it.

Another few more weeks go by and that friend on Facebook (he knows that guys family or something) said that the dudes mom posted some sob story that her son is going through some expensive court case that he likely won't win because the other team is over 10 lawyers.

Calling them a girl does not change that.                          Same goes with revenge, no matter what the excuse is.

With that said, let's begin.

This very demonic old man moved into the house next door. That is not an over exaggeration.                              He was always hateful, grouchy, and rude. At night, he will be in the backyard, doing chants and rituals in robes. From what was known, he practiced an old form of Pagan Witchcraft and he would try to summon demons with blood sacrifices. 

Ever since he moved in, the neighborhood's animals and pets started to go missing.                                               No trace, no evidence, nothing...  

My family raises chickens and even a few of them went missing.                                                                                  So I borrowed some security cameras from a friend and we had them set to watch my chicken coop and record. 

I was surprised to see the footage on the cameras of my neighbor stealing my chickens.                                     At first, we all thought it was an animal. Never thought it was him.                                                                                To make it worse, my friend and I started spying on him. One night, we were spying through his basement window. He was sacrificing the pets he stole, while chanting, and dancing on a pentagram circle. Even black candles were lit every single corner of the room.   

In his basement, he was sacrificing. So my friend and I decided to have some fun. This wasn't just revenge, but as a simple prank as well. 

First Night, we slashed his tires on his car. My friend pained a demonic symbol on the front of his car as well. 

Second Night, we Gorilla Glued his back and front door shut. Also, painted the same demonic symbol on his doors.

Third Night, we moved his mailbox to his backyard and left a letter in it. The envelope had the demonic symbol on it and the letter read, ""Release me!"" 

Fourth Night, we sprayed paint the demonic symbol all over his house and yard. 

Fifth Night, we had these recording devices that will playing walking sounds and demonic noises.                       We hid them outside his house very well. My friend and I was in my bedroom watching out the window. The devices were remote control, so once in a while we would press them. He will come outside, find nothing wrong. Go back in, and then we did it again. 

Awhile after, the police shows up to his house. He called the police about this noise. Police searched and found nothing. 

Sixth Night, he was outside for the entire night walking around. He was paranoid from that point on.

Seventh Night, he was inside. My friend and I reclaimed all our devices. We also left a note on his backdoor that read, ""WE WANT YOUR SOUL!"" 

After that, he left. The guy did not pack his stuff, did not take anything, he just left for good.                               Because a week or so later, a moving truck came by and started gathering all his stuff up.                                         We never saw this guy again.

Only if he didn't steal my chickens. 

Now that I think about it, what if he released a demon and that demon made me do all of this.                             I might think that I did, when I really didn't.

On to the story: Ever since the last few months there is this guy that used to be a customer at our business. He was unhappy about the amount of time that he had to wait for his documents, he requested to cut ties with us. We happily obliged, as this doesn't happen often for us, and usually people that cut ties are really difficult people.

Well, soon afterwards it became true: He started collecting emails of us and our partners and even remotely connected people to us and began harrasing us all each day, 4-5 times per day. The thing is, this guy seems as a rather unstable person. His emails are full of twisting of the truth, sharing company secrets (not only ours, but others as well), really defamating one or two of my colleagues, as well as writing total nonsense. For instance: ""I have had only 3 items, not 5. But dude, our system show all of your logs and activities and except for our main admin (me) not a single soul can do them in your place.""

Due to the life threatening content in some of the emails, we went to the authorities and they basically advised us and didn't pursue any action. The advise: request him to provide a public retraction and to say sorry publicly. He didn't. That action only added gas to the fire. 

So, I really want to be petty and all those kinds of adjectives and use this guys email address to do something to him. We all blocked him on our personal addresses, but he keeps on finding others and keeps harassing them. Please reddit, give me your best revenge to a person like this!

Oh boy... How long ago did this take place? Maybe 1 or 2 years ago?

A little bit of backstory, i did **NOT** come from a impoverished background. Nope, pretty much the opposite. Though, i (at least i think) did have a somewhat hard childhood. My parents divorced and i was left with my mom. My mom was really nice, but did yell quite a lot. Then a few years later, i was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease! Its called Junevile Dermatomyositis or something like that. Anyways, i spent a good amount of time in the hospital in 3rd grade. In the 3rd grade i also made a friend who lets call asshole. Asshole was actually an ok person when he was young. Though, he did cuss a lot, which was a bad sign. Idk WHAT happened to him over summer, but it changed him. He was just an innocent little kid, and then over summer, transformed into a stuck up, spiteful, greedy kid. He used to take things from me, emotionally damage me, and straight up tossed me to the ground! Basically, he manipulated me into his personal puppet. I'm not digging that deep into this kid, because you probably know the gist of it. He made my life worse.

**THE REVENGE**

I think you're gonna like this. So after 5th grade, we drifted away and made new friends (or in his case, a posse). He was an ass to me and took my food. Now, I'm naturally a HUGE snitch, but that changed a lot in 5th grade. I changed this behavior, whether for the better or worse, and powered through 5th and 6th grade with terrible academics. 7th changed this for me and I got pretty much straight A's. Lets get back to asshole. Again, he used to steal things from me and i was determined to stop him. I studied what he stole from me and what he didn't. After a month i figured that he goes after my sweets. Oh boy, did i know what to do. I always watched this company that sells crazy stuff. They also sold something called the ""Worlds Hottest Chocolate Bar"". Its basically a chocolate bar that spicier than **CAROLINA REAPER!** Holy shit, if this backfired I would be pissed. This is what happened. I bought the chocolate and its packaging was a bit too revealing, so i put it in a plastic bag and went to school. I waited till Asshole came over to steal again. When he was in close proximity, i casually took my bag out with the chocolate. This is the gist of the dialogue that played out(with OP instead of my name of course.):

Asshole: ""Hey OP, whats that?""

Me: ""Oh this? Its a very fancy chocolate bar.""

Asshole: \*snatches bag and runs off\* You're poor, i should have it!""

The next part was just plain funny.  Me and my friends ran to view this awesome event. He at the WHOLE thing. That was not part my plan. You were only supposed to eat one square, eating the whole thing, you could die. I honestly thought he would eat one square. See, he's a two face and he like to give things he stole to his mom and dad. The next thing i knew, he was coughing, gagging, and throwing up. He had to go to the nurses office, but other than that and extreme traumatization, he was fine. That, apparently, did not cause a parent conference. Now that i look back at it, was that a good thing or a bad thing. I think the reason is that i didn't offer it to him. Nevertheless, he did not bother me ever again. (Also my mother grounded me for a month, but worth it!)

The choir takes the form of an after school club, but you earn half a credit for it. The vocal class is like the choir, however, it has an actual curriculum and full credit. I am in both the choir and vocal class, as are some other kids in the music program. This particular story takes place during the vocal class. 

 Let me tell you the tale of Anita (Not her real name, but similar).

 Anita was our substitute teacher one day in early December of my freshman year. We were really cramming trying to learn our Christmas songs before the annual Christmas concert, due to some complications resulting in a few choir practices being cancelled. When we walked into the classroom to see a sub, we were all a bit worried as we still had so much to do in so little time.

 It was fine, I thought, as long as she has the right qualifications. Nope. Her first words to us were basically that she had no music qualifications and she had previously been a scientist before wanting to switch paths to teaching. Oh boy, now we had to try and learn these songs with no competent conductor. Annoying, but if one of us played the practice tracks our teacher had made on their phone it should be doable.

 So we began using the practice tracks and singing our Christmas songs, specifically one of the more religious ones. Anita stops us. ""Would you like to know the meaning behind this song?"" she asks.

 ""No thank you, we have to get these songs right before the concert,"" I reply, along with some other students. Apparently, Anita didn't hear us. She begins her great sermon.

 She literally started preaching to us about God and how we are all going to hell! In the middle of class! In a room filled with mostly atheist teens! I'm a Christian, but I absolutely hate it when others force their religion down people's throats. I tried to tune it out, thinking she will soon stop.

 I was dead wrong. Anita went on and on, and she kept repeating that we were all going to hell and that we had to repent to Jesus or face eternal damnation. One guy kept sort of egging her on, asking questions and trying to have a debate of religion. We all kept begging the guy to stop, that we didn't want to waste the class.

 10 minutes. 20. 30. Anita would not desist. I'm pissed, others are pissed. I'm beginning to hate my own religion. Anita is relentless, with more passion and intensity than the priests at my church. This went on for the entire class. Some kids got so offended (Due to either being atheists or having other religions) that they walked out of class.

 In hindsight, one of us could have left the room and told the principal, but we didn't. I think we all just thought she would stop eventually. When the dismissal bell rang, my heart sank. We had just gotten one of our last practices stolen from us, and we were still severely underprepared for the performance. 

 The entire class was fuming. Normally, if we had a bad sub, we kept it to ourself as it wasn't worth the trouble. This time though, we knew this was a serious issue. It had to be against school rules. We all unanimously decided to report the incident to our teacher the next day, as he would have the greatest reason out of any staff in the school to deal with it.

 When we all told him, we spared no details. A couple of kids had even recorded the incident. He. Was. PISSED. I had never seen this man angry or anything other than cheerful and calm. His face turned red and he stood silent for a moment. He began saying things through gritted teeth like ""She wasted all of our time"" and ""That is the most unprofessional and inappropriate thing that I have ever heard of."" He said a lot more, but I can't recall them all as this was a few years ago. 

 The teacher talked to the Principal, kids gave testimonies and showed the footage. The principal went to administration. Etc. Etc., investigation, yadda-yadda.

 The next day our teacher informed us that thanks to all our evidence and testimonies, Anita was no longer allowed to be a substitute teacher at any school. In fact, she would never be able to get any teaching job or even earn her teaching degree. Yeah, she definitely broke a lot of rules.

 Anita is kind of a legend in the music department now, but if you bring it up to the teacher, he still starts to look a little angry.

This was one of my earliest dating experiences in life. I met somebody I was rather quickly interested in, asked her out, got a yes, and decided on one of my favorite places ( a nearby habache grill place. Higher end, outside of my where I belong financially but I planned from pulling from savings so it was fine. ) we met up, talked a while then went to our reservation.  

Everything went rather fantastic, she seemed a bit distant at times but I figured it was just hunger and what not. We talked a bit seemed to have a lot of shared interests, etc, the works. 

She went to the restroom and left her cellphone face up on the table. 

 This is where the hard turn happened. 

I saw a text chunk pop up from a friend of hers. "" did you get the idiot to pay for your meal yet..."" or something along those lines. Don't quote me. I... snooped a tad, seeing another chunk of the conversation, and well... she wasn't even remotely interested, she just wanted some free food from some "" loaded idiot "". I slowly dropped her phone into her drink, grabbed my stuff and left. Left with with a 139$ bill. I went home, picked up a bottle of jack, and slowly worked on that across 3 days.

I ended up informing her father of what transpired, and he surprisingly apologized, did the same with her brother and he still said he was gonna kick my ass, heh. ( I'm heavily summarizing here. )

I found out some years later whilst snooping about that her father ended up writing her out of the will, supposedly for this and other things she did that was like it.

We finally got to the point where it's sink or swim time and she sank. 

Months go by without hearing from her and all is well. Until last week when had to pick up my brother. My brother is on methadone and he goes to the clinic once a month to pick up his medicine. No big deal, i bring him down all the time. I sit outside and wait he does his business and we go.

I come into work that same day and Becky pulls me side. ""Hey I want you to see this before it becomes a rumor."" It was a picture of me standing next to my very identifiable me truck, with a conversation that explains that Sarah has a business relationship with the clinic and how since I'm here i must be a client. 

Becky by all means is no angel. She has her finger on the pulse of the drama at my work. So this isn't necessarily good news for me. While there's nothing to be ashamed of by seeking help, i would prefer it not be associated with me.

Since Becky is a peer and not a subordinate it wouldn't effect things to badly but the fact that she loves to gossip and have people pay attention to her, i know it'll be spread. The only people that matter will believe me I'm not going to explain it to my subordinates and hope they believe me. 

I explain the basics of my visit and pull the only thing i could out of my ass to prevent Becky spreading these rumors that she's claiming to want to stop (even though she's the only person still in contact with Sarah.)

I tell Becky I don't want to involve her because she only received the message and request her to screenshot the conversation and send it to me. 

With screenshots in hand i go outside and call the clinic. Provided Sarah's full name and the screenshots. I mention my very limited knowledge of HIPAA and express how upset I am that someone that has any offical connection to the clinic would take pictures of me, my vehicle and send them to my workplace. 

Turns out that it was a violation of HIPAA as well as a violation if an even more stringent law that has to do with addiction treatment. It's been ran up to the powers that be. I've been told that her professional relationship with that clinic will end and, they would be willing to bet that, she wouldn't be able too be involved in any aspect if her field.

I might be selfish for wanting others to hear what I have to say, especially because I know there are stories on here that deserve a lot more outreach, but I'm going to share it anyway.  Here is my story.

When I (20F) was younger, I looked up to everyone on my mom's side of the family.  They were all very pretty, very rich, went to very prestigious schools, and were in very happy marriages.  I wondered if i had what it took to become a respected, decent person just like them, and I even hated myself a lot of the time because I didn't think I could do it.  It also didn't help the fact that I was chubby, loud, and not very smart lol.

The twist was that I was actually quite thin (I was 5'8"" 130 lbs), above-average smart although not like the smartest person ever (4.2 gpa, 30 ACT), and also quite accomplished (6th best violinist in the school out of 100 or so violinists + got to play at carniege hall with the symphony for a competition and got first place).  But compared to my mom's side I was fucking nothing so I basically went through high school with 0 confidence in myself to amount to anything special.  

I don't blame my mom's side for my own lack of self esteem, but I do think the high expectations messed me up a little bit.  I had 100% convinced myself that I was overweight and that my grades were shit and I should just stop trying altogether.  So in my last year of high school I gained 25 lbs and stopped going to class.  I lost the confidence to even stand next to my friends and became a total shut-in. 

When I got to college mostly everyone I knew were getting into relationships whereas I thought ""why the hell would anyone want to date someone like me"" (yeah, I know, pretty edgy).  So when someone asked me out for the first time ever I said yes without hesitation and considered myself lucky.  I never said no to him.  Anything he wanted, I would do.  I never complained when he was 3 hours late to everything, made me do his homework, and guilted me into doing sexual shit that I later regretted.  I didnt even say anything when he would victim blame sexual assault victims that came up on the news about the school (he was very religious-right).  Everyone told me to leave him but that was impossible when I had the self-confidence of a dust mite.

When I had finally gained a shred of confidence (aka tired of hearing my friends talk) after 7 months with this guy I threatened to leave him.  He guilted me back into staying by saying he would kill himself if I left.  This happened multiple times.  Until one day my parents found out and got me out of that situation.  He'd leave endless messages, get his friends (who didnt know anything) to leave messages, and even follow me into my apartment building (where you needed a key to get in) late at night.  I had to move just to make it stop.  Eventually, the cops were called but that didn't stop him either.  Serious academic repercussions were threatened which finally got him to stop.

I fell into a deep depression.  I had to drop a class and get an incomplete from another class (basically no grade until you finish the course).  I stopped going to my extra circulars.  I gained more weight.  I lost more sleep.  I made 2 separate appointments with our school's therapists but backed out of both of them last minute thinking I had lived a very privileged life and that I didn't need therapy.  My school is near a forest, so I would always go into the woods at ungodly hours of the pitch-black night and for the most part just wander around wishing I was dead.  But I also used that time to do some deep self-reflection.  Why did I act so submissively during the relationship?  Why did I think all of this was okay?  Why did I feel so guilty all of the time?  I didnt understand why I was so loyal to someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.  After months I ended up tracing back these feelings to my childhood.

My mom's side... although seemingly perfect, were actually very, very religious-right conservative.  As such, most of the women on her side were housewives.  I didn't think too much into it because they all seemed happy.  But whatever the women did, they did second to their husbands.  They didn't speak out of turn, they stayed thin (even if it meant not eating), they listened (or pretended to listen) intently when their husbands would talk about the amazing qualities of Trump.  They all cooked and cleaned.  They chose all the right words to fluff their husband's egos.  At the time I was impartial to politics so I didn't really care if they voted for this person or that person... I was just selfishly obsessed with their image of happiness.  But I started to wonder if this image was real.  Of course, I doubted myself into thinking that I was just projecting my own unhappiness onto them.  But I couldn't shake this feeling that somehow... SOMEHOW... my ex-boyfriend in some ways resembled the men in my family.

And then I found out the truth.

My father (god bless his soul) is a *very* observant man.  He is nothing like the men on my mom's side.  And on the long road trip home after school got out, he decided it was time for me to know everything.  This is what I learned.

My mom has one brother (Adam) and one sister (Lilith).

Adam made his wealth building his own firm which now employs 100+ people.  He owns multiple homes and often takes expensive vacations.  He has 3 children, two older girls and one younger boy.  He sent them all to the one of the most expensive private schools in the nation and the girls were pursuing the least lucrative degrees.  None of them use their degrees now.  But he could afford it so it was whatever.

I learned that most of his assets were a lie.  Half a decade ago, Adam's family was going through some rough financial times.  Any sane person who was financially struggling would stop flaunting their wealth at that point and scrape together their savings while possibly downsizing/selling their homes.  But nope.  He's a real shady guy.  He gamed the system and essentially put everyone's college debt onto their house and foreclosed on the house.  This basically means that anyone who was paying taxes was now also paying for 3 random rich kids's unnecessarily expensive private school tuitions.  

Tbh yeah I sort of get it if times are really tough and you need to do that in order to not die.  But my uncle Adam has no shred of guilt or care for other people.  He only did this in order to keep maintaing his lifestyle and flaunt his wealth.  He didnt suspend his vacations.  He didnt wise up.  He didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.  And now that he doesn't have to deal with all that college debt, he buys a multi-million dollar house in another, more expensive location.  Smh.  And I used to think people who were religious had some sort of moral code.

Now here comes the juicy part if it's not already juicy.

The reason why he was struggling with money in the first place was because 1) 2008 financial crisis aftermath (it was a miracle he even survived it) 2) a few years back he *JOINED A CULT AND SOLD OFF ALL HIS ASSETS AND DONATED IT TO THE CULT*

Often times I see people joking about organized religion and how they're essentially cults.  But this was a legit, illegal, organized, kool aid-esque, mid-sized cult in the city.  They were (of course) preaching about doomsday, and that everyone needed to sell off all their assets in order to be received by god in their naked state.  They also told everyone that they would *handle* everyone's assets for them.  Failure to meet such conditions resulted in your departure to h-e-double-hockey-sticks.

Adam was batshit crazy.  He would try to get everyone in the family to join the cult.  No one did.  He would go into the streets and try to get random people to join the cult.  My dad said he was embarrassed to be seen with him sometimes.  And of course, the doomsdays came and went.  And each doomsday didnt phase Adam one bit.  It wasnt until after the cult leader was arrested that Adam started to snap out of it a little bit.  But even then it took a while for him to realize what had really happened.  He never felt guilty or ashamed for essentially ruining his whole family by falling for this cult.  He held his head high and simply never mentioned it again.  To this day he admits to nothing.

He also did some other less important petty stuff like he would ""forget"" to pay back 5 grand he borrowed from a relative, or insist that his firm did a good job in x when in fact my mom has a degree in x and said that it was done poorly.  When it broke he blamed it on the weather.  Small shit but still indicative of his poor character.

Let's talk about Lilith (thank you for making it this far).

My mom's side had originally immigrated here from another country and like all immigrants started off poor.  Lilith met a man (Richard) who was studying to become an engineer at a college where she was studying to become a doctor.  This man was on a student visa from the same country my mom's side was from.  His parents were damn wealthy.  They did the architecture for some of that country's biggest universities.

Unfortunately she became rather ashamed of her poor family.  I figure that hes largely responsible for this bad mindset.  He came from a very *traditional* family in a very traditional country.  His mother was the pinnacle of a perfect woman in that society.  She was pretty, fair-skinned, and *very* submissive.  Total woman of the household.  She did all the cooking, cleaning, and never got a degree.  She didn't need one.  She took care of the children while her husband earned the money.  Dont get me wrong, I think this is fine.  But you have to really want this lifestyle.  You shouldnt be guilted into it by some ancient system that cant keep up with the times.

Thus, the man is considered the bread and butter of any household in our culture.  And Richard was that plus he was a rich asshole.  I suspect he made Lilith feel bad about her upbringing.  She stopped attending my mom's side's family events for him.  He never even introduced himself to her family.  Thats a huge HUGE disrespect in ANY culture.  And the worst part... *she changed courses to pharmacy because he told her being a doctor was too much work for girls.*

My dad later found out that this was all because he realized bioengineering was too hard for him so he switched to orthodontics and tried to get Lilith to do pharmacy so that he could still look like the bigger man.  He also tried to get my mom, who was in dental school at the time, to drop it entirely because dentistry is too much work for girls.  My mom (god bless her fucking soul) was like, ""nah"".

This dynamic continued into their marriage.  Lilith ALWAYS puts her husband first.  One time she didnt show up to my niece's wedding because it was his nephew's BIRTHDAY.  Also hes a hippocrite.  He always advocates for the woman to not work but he keeps Lilith working because her pharmacy gives her health insurance and she put him on it.  She probably earns more than him but she still gets his hand-me-down cars.  She never gets to take trips (its typical for husbands not to let their wives go on vacation out of jealousy).  She never gets to see her family.  She has to listen to all his political rantings about how Trump is the most moral person ever.  And how the church did nothing wrong and all those cases about high catholic figures molesting young children are isolated events.  He has his group of friends who think the same way as him, and they all tell his son to find a submissive wife like his mother.  And he is someone who didnt think in his whole life he could do anything wrong.

Oh also, he likes to preach to everyone about his accomplishments but its like.  Your parents gave you everything all you had to do was go to school and follow the path.  How could you ever compare to your wife, who started in this country speaking no english, in a poor family, graduated top honors, paid for it all herself, and flourished into a great career?  Idgi.

I wont go on but it doesnt end here.  Most of the women on my moms side dont have technical degrees.  Im not trying to be disrespectful towards those degrees, however this means its a lot harder for them to make money.  I looked up to all of them for the happiness I thought they had, but behind the veneers they all have piece of shit husbands who treat them lesser than.  They wont let them go out because theyre just that jealous.  They wont admit that the women are probably a lot smarter than them.  They encourage their daughters to get wealthy husbands instead of lucrative degrees.

I hate it.

I hate how whenever they come over they try to teach me lessons about living a good and honest life.  I hate how they can just live everyday acting as though they didnt just fuck over a lot of people.  I hate how they think they deserve their wealth and respect.  Like.  You.  Literally just ruined your family by making them join a cult.  And you never learned from that.  You effectively took away a womans career in order to make yourself feel more like a man.  How could I ever respect you.

And I had grown up respecting these people.  I had been taught through these subtleties how to act around men.  I had been taught through watching my role models and receiving teachings at family functions that I needed to be skinny, get a non-lucrative degree, find a rich husband, shell out some kids and pray to god everyday.  And this shame that a lot of the women on my moms side probably feel everyday is what i got a small taste of when I was with that man who resembled the men on my moms side.  I never want to feel that shame again.

SO...  What do i do.  I almost have my life fully together now in the wake of dating that guy.  I lost like half of the weight I gained in all that depression from high school and on (to be healthy, not to be skinny).  My classes are fine again, and Im on track to graduate right on time in the summer.  I switched over to a technical degree.  I dont have a job lined up yet but Ive done a few internships and im very certain ill have a well-paying job before graduation.  Ive found my friends again and im living well.

But i still have this burning need thats been going on since summer.  This need to *do something*.  I dont know what that something is.  Something that would let them know I made it without their stupid ass teachings.  Some major ""fuck you"" to every idiot who thinks women are meant to have babies and thats it.  Something that would allow my aunt not to hate her damn family anymore.  Maybe thats something she needs to figure out for herself, but ahh what can I do to help???

One day my dad told me this outrageous theory.

His theory was that she was gonna get a divorce.  He said that she doesnt rlly care about all that trump stuff and he has a crazy idea that one day in the next 10 years or so shes gonna realize she only has x amount of days left on this earth and shes gonna think ""man i cant spent the rest of it catering to this guy"" and straight up leave.  I think thats awesome and I want to be able to support her.

So 50% for my aunt and all the women in my family, 50% for my own selfish reasons, I would like to stage something grand.  Dont tell me that ""no you need to live your own life and be happy"" because ive already thought about this and as long as it benefits me and others in the long run, i would probably very much enjoy doing it.

What do i need to do?  No matter how unreasonable, id like to hear your thoughts.  Shoot for the moon and youll land amongst the stars they say.  Do i need to become rich?  Do i need to mess with them somehow (nothing outisde of the law lol)?  I wanna hear your thoughts reddit.  By the way, as i said no one thinks much of me in the family.  This is good as it gives me as it keeps me under the radar, but bad as i currently hold no power within the family.  Thats why I say i want to slow cook a massive revenge plot and reveal what ive done by the time im 30.  That gives me about 10 years.

Thank you for reaching the end omg ;;;(((

I was raised to respect the ""Law Enforcers"" and to never seek revenge.

First off, I have so many run-ins with bad cops. It's to the point where I am beginning to hate them all.

Second, I do not agree with revenge. But, I do enjoy hearing about someone else.  Even telling the story of someone else.

So this happened to my friend, Stacy. She's a pretty girl going to college. She lives three hours from the college. Don't ask me why...

It was around 10:00 PM she was still around an hour away from home. Cop pulled her over. She would not tell me the full details of her conversation with him. But she did give me the short sweet version of it. 

He accused her of running the Stop Sign and gave her a $200 (it was a bit more than that) ticket. 

He was looking at her chest giving hints of ""wanting something"" as a trade to remove the ticket from ever existing. Long story short, she showed him her boobs just to get out of the ticket.

Every time she drives down that street pass that Stop Sign, he would pull her over and it will be the same thing. She started taking a different route because of him.

Her friend, Crystal, who is a young pretty girl as well, was going to visit her. The friend has a dash cam, when a cop comes, she leaves it on, but hides it out of site. Well, that same cop pulled her over. She was polite to him, but refuse to do anything. She took the ticket and drove off. 

 Crystal used the dash cam as evidence to sue the police station. On the dash cam, he gives her a choose. She can show him the ""goods"" or get a ticket that could hurt her record.

They fired him, but that wasn't good enough for Crystal. Both Stacy and Crystal, some how was able to get this police officers home address. Not sure how, but that is not what important. 

To start, they slashed the tires on both his vehicles. They sprayed painted bad cop on his house walls.

They used Gorilla Glue on his doors. Gorilla Glue, when it drys, can stick anything to everything. 

This cop wasn't getting out of his house easily.

So, here’s some backstory. When I was thirteen and I’m middle school, I had a constant bully who I’ll call Melanie for this story. Melanie wasn’t apart of my friend group (emo, because I was thirteen and in a phase), but she wanted to be. She would listen to my friend Raven (not her name, obviously) at the time about all the piercings she wanted to get and then get them directly the next day or afterward. One time, Raven even said she wanted to get her nose pierced, when she didn’t, just to see if Melanie would do it. Sure enough, she did.

In regards to her bullying though, she bullied me because I was fat, and didn’t have enough money to buy alternative-style clothes like she could. When I say bullied, I don’t mean she would just call me names or something silly. She would throw me into lockers, spit on me, steal my writing journal (which I wrote very personal things in) and read it in a dramatic voice at the lunch table, and cyber bully me. The bullying got so bad I even attempted suicide when I was fourteen because of it, and had to switch high schools. Even when I switched high schools, the bullying continued up until I was sixteen years old, in which she promptly dropped off the face of my earth, which was heavenly.

Fast forward until I was seventeen. I reconnected with an old friend who I will call Sydney. Sydney was with a guy who I’ll call Issac for over two years. The had attended prom together, had a wedding planned out, and Sydney was pregnant with Issac’s child. However, during her pregnancy-brained hormones, she snapped and hit Isaac across the face causing Issac to break up with her. Sydney was devastated and Issac, for understandable reasons, refused to speak to her. 

Sydney is a bit of a wild card, so she hacks into Issac’s profile on Facebook and discovers that for the past year Isaac has been cheating on her with, guess who? Melanie. I get war flashbacks as she’s telling me this, and Sydney is livid. She calls and confronts Issac, who simply laughs and states how he loves Melanie and didn’t want to be with Sydney anyways. Sydney is, once again, hurt. 

Now, I don’t support what Sydney did, but I was red with anger. Melanie had hurt me so very much, and now her, a sixteen year old girl was with Sydney’s twenty year old boyfriend. What made it worse is that Melanie knew about Sydney, knew about her being pregnant, and encouraged Issac to cheat on her.

Que the pro-revenge.


Part One: The planning.

I retch out to Melanie and very calmly apologized for any wrongful doing that I had caused her in the past. Melanie, though skeptical, agreed to start trying to develop a friendship. Thus, we started talking. This went on for quite sometime, up until I discovered some very personal details about her. The main detail was that she had a premium Snapchat in which she was recording videos of her having sex with Issac for money, performing oral, and ultimately just selling nudes. Nothing wrong with this, unless you’re a minor. And oh boy, she was. She added me, another minor at the time, to her premium Snapchat for free and I watched and gathered as much evidence as I could on my phone without having pictures or video evidence of this. I wrote her Snapchat name down and gave detailed statements of everything that happened in these videos. She then added me back on her private Instagram page where it showed pictures of her smoking pot (it’s illegal in my state, unfortunately), and shooting up heroine. It even showed her doing cocaine. She was a self-proclaimed “hippy” and liked to brag about it. I took all photographic evidence and video evidence I could of this and continued being her friend. 

Melanie apologized “profusely” for what she done to me in middle and high school and invited me to her graduation. I attended, mainly because I had nothing better to do, and that’s when I discovered she was pregnant with Issac’s baby. Perfect. That was enough evidence I needed alone to fuck her and Issac’s life all to hell.

Part Two: The Revenge.

I called an anonymous support hotline for children’s sexual violence and gave my name, and statement. Then, I honestly forgot about it. Then, around the time of my eighteenth birthday four months later, I get called into my local police department for an interview. I gathered all the evidence of my revenge and took it to the interview with my mother disapprovingly watching the entire time. Afterwards, I get a call from Melanie telling me she is having a boy. Wow. Congratulations. 

Part Three: The Outcome.

Within the next month, I get a court summons and I have to testify against Melanie in court. Melanie has sense been arrested and put in a juvenile detention center and when she saw me walk into that courtroom, her eyes went wide and she had to be detained because she tried to leap and attack me. I testified against her, and then had the option to sit and watch the whole thing go down.

Melanie was sentenced to five charges of possession of illegal narcotics, and one count of distribution of child pornography. She was then sentenced to the rest of her minor years in juvenile detention where she will promptly be taken to prison to serve a whopping 17 years and five months in prison with probation after release, and no chance of parole. I later found out Issac was charged with statutory rape and was sentenced to 15 months behind bars with chance of parole. Though I’m not certain, I’m pretty sure her child had to be put into foster care, due to Melanie’s parents also being incarcerated. 


Sydney gave birth to a healthy baby girl, and though we’re not friends anymore from unrelated issues, she thanked me profusely after finding out what I did, and I couldn’t be more satisfied either.

I go into the logs to write a warning list (we do this in case a contestants is wrongfully eliminated or banned) I found out that Gary had sent the girl who called me, James, and the hit death threats and even said he was gonna report James to me admin abusing, and here's where the revenge happens, ""we were, and you completely abused your powers.""

Not a super malicious story, but definitely rude/undesirable/inconvenient. I am a female and was about 16 years old at the time.

My mother is a devout Southern Baptist. Her church preaches ideals that I do not agree with. They don't approve of gays (I have stayed a closeted bi-sexual around her), they say masturbation is bad (? god shoulda made ur arms shorter if he didn't like that), women cannot be elders, etc. To me, these are major issues.

Mom made us go to church just about every Sunday from the day I was born until that fateful day. We went to an 8:30 A.M., hour-long service where the preacher did his thing and then we attended Sunday School for about an hour. I was a teenager, angsty, trying to figure myself out, and desiring more independence. I became tired of having to attend a church whose core values I firmly did not agree with. So, one Sunday I refused to go.

This pissed the living shit out of her. We argued for a while and then she decided to punish me by taking away the door to my room. I very much so value my privacy, as I am the only female sibling and my father was the stay at home parent. Also, privacy is just nice. We were not allowed to have locks on our doors so it wasn't like she couldn't barge in.

I thought this absolutely ridiculous, so I retaliated. I got butt naked, stood in my open doorway and made loud, strange noises- meowing, groaning/moaning, barking. This naturally drew her attention, only for her to find me naked. This absolutely appalled her and she had no clue what to do. She told me to get dressed, so I did NOT, just continued my charade. My dad eventually came up to see what the hell my noises were about and I yelled, ""I AM BUTT ASS NAKED"". I was fully prepared to bend over and moon him if he actually got to the doorway. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to upset them with a view of my arsehole. My dad immediately gave up and insisted mom return my door. She argued for a while and eventually, and quite begrudgingly, gave it back. She made me put the door back on (she was perfectly able to take it off), additional rudeness on her part. 

This only took about 30 minutes. 

HA! I WIN! It is totally feasible to weird someone out enough that you get your way. \~Weirdness manipulation\~

She never bothered me about attending church again. :DDD

When we met she was really sweet and we had a lot in common. Same taste in music, movies, worked at the same theme park (it’s a big place which is why we never ran into each other at work) and we got along really well. Early on in the relationship she made it known to me that I was her first... well everything. First kiss, first date, first boyfriend, and I was the first person she slept with. Understanding this I told her honestly that I was honored and will do my best to give her the best relationship possible, I didn’t want to ruin guys or anything for her. Also, because of me being her first we talked IN DEPTH that if she ever wanted to leave me and see what else is out there (experience other guys) she had the total right to do so. If we weren’t meant to be we weren’t meant to be. 

Anyways, we dated for about 6 months. Most of her friends had moved away to college the year before so she quickly latched onto my friends who welcomed her with open arms, I love my friends they are the best. For most of our time together it was great. We did get in a couple arguments from time to time but nothing bad, just your basic “I want you to buy me flowers more often!” “Babe I just took us to San Francisco last week and paid for the whole trip. I’m kinda broke right now.” “We’ll that isn’t a valid excuse” whatever, things like that basically that we ended up solving. I greeted her everyday with kisses and hugs and instantly asked how was school or work. 

Right around the end of our relationship, I could tell it was coming to a close by the way she stopped looking me in the eye when she talked to me, she was spending more and more time with her “co-workers” after work. In specific one guy we will call Andy, to be honest I don’t even remember his name.         (Backstory on ANDY): this guy invited me and my ex to his place with some of our other friends for drinks one night. Me and him were getting along and he mentioned how his ex just cheated on him and he didn’t understand how anyone could ever do that to someone *ALERT REMEMBER THAT BS*. I saw him constantly looking at my EX and sitting right next to us and talking to her. This made me uneasy.       (back to the main story).  My ex told me one day that Andy was taking her to the gym and she asked if I was ok with it. Me knowing the mind of a guy instantly said “I am not comfortable with that because I don’t trust his intentions” she then combats that statement with “Oh grow up it’s just the gym what could possibly happen, plus he is just a friend.”  Being that this was all over text there was not much I could do besides say no. She ends up going to the gym with Andy. At this point I should mention we both have each others locations programmed into our phones because we would hang out until late and when the other would leave to go home we wanted to make sure that the late drive home ended safely. I checked her location the day of the gym and saw she was in fact at a gym. Some relief. I was sort of proud of her because she used to be fairly big and was trying to lose weight, mainly by starving herself which I constantly disproved of and as a former track athlete was trying to get her to go on runs with me all the time. 

This pattern or gym stuff kept happening, and I was starting to be ok with it. UNTIL I start noticing she is hanging out in a parking lot for hours on end after work. This brought back my uneasy feeling. This continues for about 2 weeks until it’s the evening before our 6 month anniversary, I had lined up reservations at a nice Italian place and got us tickets to a luxury movie theater that cost me $60! Anyways, she was supposed to stay with me that night and I’m waiting for her to show up at 4 like she said. 2 hours pass and no word from her so I check her location. She is in the parking lot again. Starting to get worried I message our friends if they have heard from her. They said no and asked what was going on. So I explained. I didn’t want to be nosy so they offered to drive by the parking lot as they were only a couple miles away from it at the time. BOY WERE THEY IN FOR A TREAT. 

I was not there for this so this is all from my friends. They found her car easily as it was one of the few. They pulled up and walked over to the car to find my ex having sex with Andy! They apparently got into a huge argument with who were at the time our friends saying “How could you do this to OP? He has been nothing but kind to you!” Then my ex would say “Stay out of my business, why are you creeps even her. FUCK OFF, and don’t tell OP any of this or else!”

This came as a shock to me when they called. I had a hunch, but still... needless to say when she finally did arrive I forced her to come clean. Her first response was “I am so sorry you weren’t suppose to know.” Haha ok whatever.  I asked how long this was going on and she admitted about a month. That got me mad.  I was staying calm but inside I was burning up. Remember I told her if she felt like she needed new experiences that was fine and I’d be ok breaking up for that. I brought this up and she said “well you treat me so well I thought you wanted us to stay together forever thats why I did this I needed out.” So me clearly being the only logical person in this conversation at the tjme said “Then why didn’t you break up with me?” She said that “I didn’t want to break your heart.” So I guess she figured cheating on me for a month was a better option. 

We still saw the movie cuz the tickets were in our names and they were expensive. Plus I’d been waiting to see this movie for a while. It was a good movie, but bad company. She pulled the typical “let’s just be friends” and ended up dating Andy. Who if you remember had just been cheated on and couldn’t understand  how someone could do that... hypocrite. I even reminded my ex about that and said “He knew we were happy but still slept with you after he got cheated on, I wouldn’t put it past him to cheat on you so be careful.” She just said I was full of it. Ok honey whatever you say. 

Our friends despised her but due to her convincing ways she kept managing to be invited to social events with the rule of she couldn’t bring Andy. This went in for about a month until she called me saying that Andy threatened to dump her is she kept hanging around me. Cue revenge plot.  “Oh no really? But we are friends I though?” I said over the phone while a huge grin came across my face. “We are and I don’t want to lose you.” This is getting way to easy. So I decide that maybe we should hang out just the two of us every now and then. She didn’t seem to mind. I hated every second of this but knew it was gonna be great in the end. 

I do this for a few months and even meet this girl who lived pretty far away but was nice so I drove up to spend a weekend with her. My ex was not happy. 

She was with Andy and his family in Vegas and called me while I was with this new girl. 
“Andy just yelled at me in public I can’t believe him.” 
She was crying heavy but I was with this new girl and she was in the other room so this had to be a quick convo. 
“Uhh ok I’m sorry to hear that why did he yell at you.” I said annoyed. 
Crying she said “it’s because I keep talking to you.” 
I started to laugh but stopped myself “ok then why are you talking to me now?” 
“Because you’re such a good friend I needed to tell you and talk to you about my problems.”
“Well I’m with a girl right now so I gotta go.”
She got furious 
“UMMM EXCUSE ME WHY ARE YOU WITH A GIRL??!!!”
I was so confused “What do you mean? I can do what I want I’m a single guy.”
She kept screaming and eventually I could hear her say word for word “You are still mine and will always be mine!” 
I hung up on her crazy ass. And sat back down with this new girl.

Things ended up not working out with new girl which was fine. 

No less than 5 days later I get my ex crying over the phone AGAIN.
“Hey ex what is it this time.”
“*sob* *cry* *sniffle*”
“Uh hello?”
“Can I come over”
Hell no bitch
“Absolutely not what happened?”
I had a feeling where this was going and I had an expensive beer in my fridge waiting for this exact moment but I didn’t expect it to be this damn good. 
“I found Andy in bed with one of my coworkers and he dumped me!”
Ahahahaha you don’t say.
She went in saying how it’s cuz she kept hanging out with me whenever she could. 
“Well,” I was about to put the final nail in the coffin, the few words we all wanted to say growing up, “I. Told. You. So.”

And we had a long talk about what happen and agreed we were all bad people.

Here are the key players:

Mom: the hero of the story

Dad: father

Grandma: dad's mother

Grandpa: dad's father

Cool Grandma: mom's mom

My paternal grandparents aren't bad people, but they are, in fact, pretty twisted. The same grandparents who can show themselves to be sweet (well, mostly my grandma) to my sister and I are also judgmental, hypocritical, controlling, and lie. A lot. There are honestly so many stories I can tell but I'll pick the one that humiliated them the most.

My mom has gotten along with them, because she has been a good person to both of them and helped them out when their own children (my aunts and uncles, not my dad) couldn't/wouldn't. She's also not the kind of person to fly off the handle. She plans her revenge.

The details are fuzzy on this part, but what I do know is that my mom got into an argument with my grandma over something stupid. My grandma gets really mad and storms off. Next thing they know, my dad gets a call from his business from one of their workers. My grandpa - who works at the business as an employee - has been cussing about Cool Grandma. Like using really angry, vulgar language. My parents eventually figure out it's related to the argument my mom and grandma had, and that she must've told my grandpa.

My dad confronts his mom, and she ""swears to God"" she never said anything to my grandpa. Grandma says she didn't even talk to Grandpa that day.

Here's the thing: at the time, my parents were paying for their phone bill. Sensing something was up, Mom looked up the bill and, sure enough, Grandma called Grandpa *minutes* after she stormed out of the house.

Remember when I said they were hypocritical? Grandma is a holier-than-thou Catholic. Dad was heartbroken because he realized she blatantly lied to him *and* brought religion into it when she ""swore to God"". My mom was also furious. Not because Grandma and Grandpa shit-talked her, but because Grandpa shittalked Cool Grandma, *who wasn't even there*.

**Cue the revenge**

The next time the entire family fathered - parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, you name it - my mom brought up the argument again. Both grandparents deny it, of course, and start getting defense.

Mom then brings in her laptop with the phone bill information on it, and says to Grandma, ""You didn't talk to Grandpa? You *swore to God* you didn't? Then what's this?""

From the recounting of the tale, mom says Grandma and Grandpa had serious oh shit looks on their faces. Mom cut off their attempts to talk, calling them out on not just lying to their son, but also trying to paint the honest worker who informed on their as a liar, and *especially* for saying horrible things about Cool Grandma.

Mom then *plants* the laptop on the room's main table for everyone to see, and tells the room (first addressing my aunts and uncles): ""Look at your mother, *the liar!*""

Everyone had a chance to look at it, and I don't think anyone tried to defend Grandma and Grandpa for their actions. Those two started apologizing. It was pretty clear it was because they'd be caught and shamed, but there might've been real remorse.

Hello everyone,

I am Mr Wiggly Wiggles. But you can call me Wiggles for short.

Before I tell my story, there are a few things I want to say.

First off, If I say something offensive, I am sorry. But please do us all the favor, and grow up...

Second, this story is true.

Third, this is my first time having an ""interaction"" with a Cop. But not the only time. I have so many interactions with the police and on the most ridiculous things, that my friends and family are calling me the ""Black Incognito"". Please do not ask what it means, it is not important.

With the stories I have about my interactions on police, I am going to be posting more on Reddit.

So now, let us begin this wiggly story of my first interaction with a police officer and my revenge.

Many years ago, when I was 15, my family moved to a good size town. One section was farms, another was wealthy homes, and in the middle was a shopping section. After a week of living there, my girlfriend came down to visit. We decided to walk around the town and check out the stores.

The stores were an hours walk from my house. We went, grab some well needed items, and started back home. We did not have ""Netflix and Chill"", we had ""VHS and Fooling Around"". Do not judge, these were good times. My family was gone for the day, so our goal (mainly my goal) was to get home quickly to begin our fun. For the first time in my life, I was given the privileged of having a TV in front of my bed... AND I INTEND TO USE IT!

So on our way home, when we hit the halfway mark to my house, it starts raining...

We were wearing summer clothes while it started down pouring. Make matters worse, a cop drives by. He spins his police cruiser around in a crazy U-Turn, pulls up next to us, and asks ""can I help you"". My girlfriend is the polite, nice, angle type. So I let her do all the talking. She explained how I recently moved into town and how she was visiting me. Then she explained how we went to the store for some thing and now we are caught up in this down pouring storm. To top this all off, she asks the officer if he could give us a ride home. I guess my girlfriend looks like a major bullshitter, because he did not believe a single word of it. He demanded to see our ID... To appease him, we gave are student ID. Here's a good laugh, they were not good enough for him. HE WANTED ACTUAL DRIVER LICENSE, FROM TWO 15 YEAR OLD KIDS! Not only that, but he tried saying how suspicious we looked. Even gave us some bullshit of knowing every person in the town and since he doesn't know us, that is why we were stopped.

We were in the rain with this douche bag for 30 minutes at least. My name is Mr. Wiggly Wiggles, NOT Mr. Non-Wiggly No Wiggles! For all this time, I could have been home with my girlfriend, doing the Dance of the Wiggly. But no, I get a fat cop that looks like Peter Griffin questioning us in the rain.

So after the interrogation, he apologize, but gave the excuse of doing job for the reason ""WHY"". When my girlfriend gave a second attempt of asking him for a ride home, (don't know why) he apologized and politely said no with a hilarious reason. Not a joke, someone was contacting him on his Talky Toy. So he said sorry kids, there is an emergency at Dunkin Donuts. Then the bastard took off.

Here's is my revenge part. Remember, all actions has consequences. So please do not try this at home.

Revenge: When he was driving away, I lifted up both my middle fingers high to the sky and screamed ""YOU S#$K, YOU F#$K@$G A#$H#$E! YOU COPS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR LICKING S##T AND BULLING!""

Cop did not see it nor hear it. My revenge was complete and it felt really good.

As for the consequences of my action, my girlfriend was pissed. I received no ""VHS and Fooling Around"" and I was not aloud to perform my Dance of the Wiggly. Day ruined....

Hope you enjoy my painful story. Sad part, this is true. I am going to write a book about all my police interactions. Believe me, this is only the beginning.

Sincerely,

Also, this story is not about my revenge, but that of my great uncle and a favorite of everyone in my family.

When my mom was a kid, she had an uncle who owned a turkey farm. He also had a personal vegetable garden where as done might expect with a basically endless supply of good fertilizer, he was able to grow some very large pumpkins. Unfortunately, these pumpkins often gained the attention of the local hooligans and were stolen or smashed more often than not. 

One year, he decided enough was enough and began his revenge plan. He decided he was going to take some of his best pumpkins that year and display them in the front yard (carving my mom and uncle's names in them as a rare nice gesture for them). Before they were even fully grown, however, he prepared the yard with tons of turkey made fertilizer, which is apparently not very sturdy to walk on. He then allowed some grass to grow on it and come October, he was ready to place the pumpkins.

 Late at night, he went out with a bunch of wooden planks, some for the pumpkins to sit on, and two to walk on in order to get to the middle of the yard and back. A few nights later, his plan came to fruition when he heard yelling in the yard. He walked out to his front porch to see a couple teenagers up to their waists in turkey shit and unable to get themselves out. 

My great uncle promptly called the cops to pull these kids out and he never had pumpkins stolen again. 

I never knew this uncle and my mom described him as someone who she never really appreciated until she was much older, but this made him a legend in our family.

But let me slap my Fresh Prince of Bel-Air soundtrack and tell you guys the story all about how, I twisted my Landlord upside down...  
An unspecified number of years ago, I was kicked out of my grandma's house. I had just interviewed for a new job as a store manager at X company and went out into the wild searching for a new place to live quickly. I live in New York where room rentals are very common, rent is a killer here. So I found one of these room rental places in a 2-story building that sort of looks like an old house that was converted into multiple businesses. I walk in, introduce myself to this very nice old lady who runs the place. I tell her I am looking for a room to rent, I'd like a large space with internet access I didn't even ask for anything else because we all know...The Internet is all we need to live baby! She says I look like a nice young man and says ""Well I have a room fitting that description right next door"" I am like ""Oh yeah? can I go see it?"" she tells me it is literally across the hall from her business. She gets up and walks me over opens the door directly in front across the hallway and lo and behold there is indeed a big room with a Queen Size bed, a mini-fridge and super old TV in it. She tells me the tenant that was living there recently moved out and she is renting this room herself, I'd get access to the bathroom (which she shows me next) there's a tub inside the bathroom (of the business) and a very small water heater. She continues telling me the perks would be I'd not have to pay her broker fee since I'd be renting directly from her (who doesn't like saving money!?) and I'd get a private room as the business closes in the evening I can be as loud as I want, bring over whoever I want to my room, and it sounded exactly like the sort of thing you'd want when you first move out of home. Great, I am on-board. Where do I sign?   
I start my new job and new living arrangements almost simultaneously and it was all great. Best feeling in the world for like 1 week, when I run into the first issue. The room had a sink built inside, which I would use to wash dishes and stuff, the pipe was leaking. She had told me she would get this fixed when I initially noticed it the first days there, she said ""Just put a bucket under it. It doesn't leak that much water"". I did exactly that, days later I came home from work to what seemed to be an indoor pool, water everywhere. Fucked up all the new tiles it did, she was across the hall so I threw tons of Bounty down and call her over to see this mess she was like ""Oh no! I'll get someone to come fix that as soon as they are available"" I wait around all night, no one comes, I call out of work the next day so I can make sure this leak doesn't fuck my shit up, my mom comes over to visit and sees the damage and tells me that If she were me she'd drill a hole near the pipe and let it leak downstairs so that the landlord feels more motivated to get her handyman to come and fix this shit. I am pissed off but I'm not 'there' yet, I wait upset but patiently. Her guy finally shows up after I've spent all morning and afternoon dumping buckets of water and checks the pipes, tells the landlord that these pipes are very very old and need changing, she asks him if there's any quick cheaper repair that can be done (of course) and he says he can mend it but eventually it will occur again. First red flag.   
2 months later I am going about my business in my room and BAM the lights go out everything. No electricity. I am confused as fuck this is NY...did we just have a blackout? NOPE. I go out and it's just me by now it is Winter, it is starting to get cold and I have no heating, no lights, no entertainment, nothing. I endure through the night (the business side was long closed). The next day, I go to work as usual bring my phone and laptop charger and everything and call the business from work to inform the Landlord lady that I have no electricity and need that fixed ASAP. It's cold and there's no heating there. She says the same shit from before ""I'll get someone to come out as soon as he's available"" I stress to her the importance of having electricity if nothing else just so that I can turn my electric heater on she says ""oh the electricity works in the bathroom just use an extension in the meantime from the bathroom. I do exactly that and it works somewhat, her extension was one of those where a plug with 3 prongs (not sure what they are called) doesn't fit. So I can't plug the heater but hey....I can charge my phone and of course, I immediately look for a source of free wifi and tho I am cold and completely in the dark, I get by much better than the previous night because the internet is just sooo soothing to the soul.   
By now I've spent 2 nights without electricity and I'm still not hearing about this handyman of hers so I leave work a bit early (being in charge has its perks) and I head home to confront her and demand this fixed. She is being dismissive and can't understand why I'm stressing over this so much. That night I called 411 (or was it 311?) as I sat there in the Dark to report this bullshit to the department of housing. I speak to the Operator and tell her the situation and that I want to know who to report this to, she looks up my address and asks a series of questions and I stress that it's getting colder and I have no heating and no electricity for 3 days now and I'm sick of it. She then informs me that she's having trouble finding my residence and double-checks the address. She then informs me that it seems I am in an area not designated as RESIDENTIAL, this is a business address and I should not be living there as it is illegal to do so, as it is not fitted for living quarters. I am surprised by this and honestly scared so I ask...wait so what happens if I report this situation? She informs me that they'd send an inspector out, the landlord would get in trouble and I'd be made to move out within 3 days after the determination of it not being residential. I had NO FUCKING IDEA that living there was illegal I mean the landlord runs what amounts to a real estate business you would think that they KNOW what is and isn't legal to rent. I am a noob at this, but this news promptly scared me off as I was NOT ready to move out any time soon I had just moved in and it took a LOT of effort bringing all my shit there from home no way was I going to put myself in a position where I'd be forced to move out for snitching. I kept my mouth shut and called my mom for advice. Mom said she'd come over tomorrow and stay at my place while I am at work so I can stress less and she'd ask the landlord lady regarding the repairs. Great.   
4th-day rolls in I go to work, I leave mom the keys. She calls me near the end of my shift and tells me the handyman is here, and he is repairing what seems to be like a short circuit in this odd electric hazard set up that they had (wires were sticking out and shit) he says the wires are old and they rubbed the wrong way so it fucked up everything but he patched it up. I get home and I speak to mom then I speak to the Landlady and I ask her if there will be a discount on rent (mom told me I should demand one) for the inconvenience, the Landlady refused and said there are no discounts, these things happen and If I am that dissatisfied I can just move out. This pisses me off and I inform her that I called and reported this bullshit to the department of housing because it is irresponsible and hazardous. This seems to take her by surprise and she then tries a different approach and speaks to me in a nicer tone, even trying to appeal to me by saying I shouldn't speak so rudely in front of my mother blah blah blah, but I was having none of that shit, gave no flying fucks who was there, I needed her to know that this was NOT cool. I would pay her the full amount of rent but this better is the last time I am left for days without something so essential to living. I then also told her that I wanted to upgrade the bathroom to have a real water heater (the current set up could give you maybe a pint of warm water every 5 minutes...you can imagine showering wasn't viable. Oh, that's right there was NO SHOWER! Forgot to mention that...she had a huge water heating tank but had not installed it because she was looking for someone to install it cheap. Mom stepped in and said she knows someone who will do it and would not charge much the landlady agreed. Mom's friend was a professional and owed her a favor (No...I don't want to know why) and did the work for free for us, but told me to tell the Landlady that he charged me $200 for installing a shower and he'd charge her $200 for the work (this was about a third of the regular price for such an installation) he also was kind enough to properly address the electric hazard so that it doesn't happen again. And informed me that the Landlady insisted that he install an on/off switch for the water heater so that it doesn't consume too much electricity. He explained all this to me when I got home and showed me that he did as she asked but placed the switch on the inside of my room so that I would be in total control of it and that I should never turn it off but it'll get her off my back if she thinks I do.  
After this event, she started being much much nicer, and repairs were taken care of in a decent amount of time. It wasn't all roses, we clashed a bit but to be honest, we started getting along one time she was late on HER rent and she asked me if I could pay my rent in advance, and I said 'sure no problem' went down to the bank withdrew some funds and got her out of her bind. I had a bit of a bachelor pad going and I enjoyed the privacy and being able to watch all manner of internet shenanigans full volume (you guys know...you knooooow exactly what I mean) any how. Things are going great! Then...much like in street fighter...\*HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER\*  
The Landlady's son arrives after I've been living there for over a year and I start seeing him around the office in the back when I pass by to say hello to her after I arrive from work (yeah go figure, that was somewhat part of my routine) moving things along after some months of seeing him lurking in the background. During this time I noticed that the hygiene in the bathroom plummeted not that it was great, to begin with, but it quite literally turned to shit. I would come from work to find a clogged bathroom, all manner of craziness in there I took photos at this point I had started taking photos of the crazy shit I was finding, not even sure when I started but I even started recording conversations with the landlady ""just in case"". So I went to speak with her regarding the bathroom situation and while I am complaining to her about the state of the bathroom (it was never like this prior) her son decides to interject himself into the conversation and tells me that they are NOT responsible for the state of the bathroom and If I don't like it I can go clean it myself and I am confused because #1 - Who the fuck is this guy and why is he getting in the middle of this? #2 - This is YOUR business's bathroom and I am NOT your janitor bro. Fuck outta heaaaa.   
I tell him that I am a Tenant. And I use that bathroom daily and clean up after myself, I expect that at the very least when they exit their business that they leave a working toilet or at least NOT clogged with shit all over. Now we get into a shouting match...well he does, I am recording this conversation so I am keeping my chill as much as I can, he tells me that he is in fact the REAL LANDLORD here and points to a business license certificate under his name on the wall and that his mother simply takes care of the business while he is away on other business or vacationing. I inform him that I've been living there for like a year already and I did not rent from him, I rented from his mother and on top of all this, I've been a great tenant always paying my rent in advance even, and though I was fully aware that they were renting to me illegally after the electricity fiasco, I still paid and behaved appropriately without taking advantage. This infuriates him, he wants me OUT effective immediately, and while he is going on his rant the landlord lady and her husband are trying to be reasonable and talk the ""Real Landlord"" down she pulls me to the side, takes me to the bathroom area and talks to me about the whole illegal rental thing saying ""Yeah it's not illegal for me to rent this, it's illegal for the landlord, but he never comes around but this is our business and we can do whatever we want. But here if the problem is the bathroom being clean we can help each other I'll clean up before we leave and you keep it clean when you are here"" I ask her about this whole ""I am the real landlord here"" business that her son mentioned, she said it's true the business belongs to him but she runs it and he doesn't deal with it but shortly she is planning on retiring and will hand it off to her son's wife who will be taking over within a couple of months to a year. Oh, oh...a year goes by and she informs me of the upcoming changes. After summer she is retiring and her son and his wife will carry on, but that things will remain the same and won't affect my tenancy status, she's spoken to them and it's all good. I am fired from my position as a manager (a story for another day) about 3 months before her retirement. I am broke, my boss screwed me over big time, I can hardly afford to eat, let alone rent. I inform the landlord lady and I put all my energy into job hunting I had enough saved to cover 2 months of rent and I did so but started eating a lot of noodle soup and other $1 meals lol to survive until I got a job (if you don't understand the struggle...count your blessings) August rolls by and I am COMPLETELY FLAT BROKE I can't pay that month at all I let her know that I will pay her in the future when I start working (after 2 years of paying her in advance and doing favors) I had earned enough goodwill that she was okay with this and knew I was good for it. She would retire and I would be owing ""her"" the money but since the new Landlords will be on their independent run, I would need to pay them the rent as usual. Okay, I agree. I finally find a job at the very end of the 3rd month of unplanned unemployment and I start working at the very end of August, after 1 week at my new job I get a call from another place I interviewed at for even better pay and of course I accept, I end up with 2 jobs now and I give no fucks after nearly starving you'd be surprised at how motivated to work you'd be if you knew it would get the bills paid and food on the table. I haven't even received my first paycheck yet when Landlady starts hounding me for her money, ""I know you started working again, and I want to get paid before I retire or soon thereafter"" and I remind her that I just started...usually you have to wait 1 or 2 weeks to get the first check, and she had agreed that I could pay her SLOW since I had to also pay her son the regular rent which I clearly can't pay 2 at a time and there was no rush before when we spoke. She says ""okay she'll arrange with her son so I can deliver payments,"" I tell her I rather not deal with him, and would rather give the money to someone else for her payments. (I wanted to avoid that collision) she agrees and has her niece collect payments.   
Sorry for the long story, I will write part 2 tomorrow. All this backstory is sort of needed to understand the elements of the ""Revenge"" that will come later and how they chipped away at goodwill.

I had only been there about a month and had to call HR about issues...anyways, long story short. I go to HR and complain and a few days later I notice him being noticeable diffrent, nicer etc.

I have a really good sense about when things are going to happen, and I know the company is going to get as much out of me as possible before replacing me.

I checked Craigslist daily and 3 days before my probation period was about to end I saw an ad for my position come up.

I end up calling in ""sick"" when I come back (a day after my probation has ended) im given walking papers and my last check. But they forget to put my vacation time on my check (company policy is that they don't pay out vacation time if you don't pass probation, and the check is dated the day before my probation would have ended)

So I casually wait 29 days and then call HR and inform them I haven't received my vacation time and they owe me a full day's pay for every day since being fired I haven't received my pay.

They tell me they have to check with there legal deparent and make sure blah blah...I tell them that's fine, I have a rep from the labor board and an attorney they can speak with, who I've already talked to..they insist on speaking with there own legal department, cool man that's fine.

I work at Victoria secret so I get a discount and buy some really nice bras I work hard for my paycheck and love taking advantage of my employee discount. My sister in the other had doed not work or save up to buy herself nicer bras. Our family is pretty poor so our clothes tend to come off the rack from walmart. So being able to afford Victoria Secrets bras is a real treat for myself.
But there is one big problem. My sister keeps taking them and wearing with it asking for permission. (Which makes no sense because we aren't even the same cup size. She's a A and I'm a C.)

Now I know she has for sure been taking them because they kept going missing and when I went looking for them I would find them buried at the bottom of her dirty laundry. I've confronted her about this on multiple occasions which her justification is always that I'm being stingy and selfish. These fights always end in a shouting match. Our mom always takes her side saying she's your sister it's just a bra. But to me even though it's just a bra it's the principle of the matter. The last one she ""borrowed"" she ruined in the washer by breaking one of the hooks because she didn't take proper care of it. 

So I decided since our mom wasn't going to stop her I would. I went online and ordered some itching powder and sprinkled it into the cups of one of my bras to teach her a lesson to stop stealing my bras. Whelp she stole the bra as predicted and the itching powder worked a lot better than I anticipated because she scratched herself raw from it. When we got home today she started screaming how it was all my fault that now she has hives and splotchy marks all over her breasts because she scratched herself raw. I yelled back that it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't taken my bra without permission and besides how was she even wearing them without stuffing them because they are too big for her anyway!

I live in a “half double” sort of, but there are 3 apartments in one building (that looks like a regular house). We share the same backyard and all three tenants have a dog. We moved in in this last summer, and shortly after we brought home our sweet soft coated wheaten terrier puppy. The first week we got her, our neighbor reported us to the landlord for him stepping in dog poop. The weird thing is, every since this summer, we haven’t seen that neighbor  EVER take his dog (a little derpy dog the size of a cat) outside to the yard. Never. We have cameras that show the front of the building on the street, and also on the back porch where the lawn is and where our door is and we get notifications of motion on our phones, so when I say we NEVER see him take his dog out, I really mean it. Anyways, last week, I got home from work around 11pm, and I went inside to get the recycling ready to go outside. I put my dog outside on the line during this time, while I do what I need to do. About 15 minutes later, we let Millie in and she’s limping and crying with each step. We are horrified, because there is NOTHING in the yard that could have done this to her, plus she’s on a line so she couldn’t have wandered off. Anyways, while we are checking her out, we get a knock on the door. It’s the police, they say our neighbor called them to report us abusing our dog. We are in total shock. He quickly sees that we aren’t hurting our dog in any way, and leaves. After this we decide to pull up the footage from the camera because at this point we are already putting together something in our head. There is one part of the yard, the part closest to the driveway and my neighbors door, that is not in view of the camera. We see me bringing her out, us going back in, then her walk off camera. All of a sudden, you hear a door open (the only door in earshot of that camera besides mine is his) we then hear footsteps walk down his porch steps, and the steps get closer and louder on the camera, a little movement then my dog crying out in pain 3 different times. We then hear my neighbor say something, sound of footsteps fade and we hear him walk up his porch steps and his door open and close again. A minute later we bring Millie inside. This motherfucker hurt my dog. We brought her to the vet, and he said it was blunt force trauma, like she was kicked at least once, really hard. It’s been almost a week since this happened; she is still limping. The day after it happened, my boyfriend was taking the garbage out and the neighbor went outside and smirked at my boyfriend. My boyfriend said calmly “I know what you did to my dog” and the guy TOTALLY freaks out, screaming and yelling that my dog is stupid. He tried lying and said he came home from the hospital and saw my dog hurt, which is a lie because we would have seen him on our second camera walking down the driveway to his house. He straight up lied and tried to fight my boyfriend. My boyfriend is on probation, has been for almost 4 years. He gets off in a month, but he has a perfect probation record (no violations or anything) so he can’t be fighting the neighbor because of this. My landlord basically said she can’t get involved, and because it’s only audio, the evidence we have is “circumstantial”. I really want to make my neighbor pay for what he did to my dog. She is so very sweet, she thinks everyone is her best friend and she doesn’t even bark at people. She looks like a little 20 lb teddy bear. If anybody has any ideas on how I could get my revenge on a piece of shit animal abuser, please let me know because I really would like to get him back.

So, a little bit of backstory to make sense of this situation. I was raised by an narcissist alcoholic dad and a mom who was too weak to even admit that dad has a problem. I was taken by my country's equivalency of Social Services and placed in a fosterhome. I've lived in 4 different homes, the 3 first neglected me in their own ways. Fourth one was a friends family who graciously took me in. I am very happy here. Anyways: Christmas 2019 rolls in.

I get a snarky invite from my bio-mom to come to the family cabin to celebrate with my biological family and relatives. I thank her but turn it down as there usually is much drama. I wanted to rest, and enjoy myself. Everything goes smoothly and bio-mom and bio-sister comes back. She is gonna drop by and leave some gifts. I am at the teenage phase where I no longer view gifts as materialistic stuff, only as a symbol and kind gesture. I meet up with my mom and she gives me a letter. I see that it's from my hateful grandpa. I ask ""isn't there more from Aunt 1 and 2?""

My bio-moms face lights up with maliciousness. ""No."" I am taken a little aback by this. ""But bio-sister got from both.""  
This was a little bit of a hard-to-swallow-pill, as I am a very respectful person. I just glaze over it, and ask ""I wonder why they would give bio-sister but not me?"" and bio-mom responds ""maybe you would've gotten something if you celebrated with us"". We say good bye and I go to my adoptive family. Ado-Mom sees something is wrong and I explain how my aunts forgot about me. She just nods and carries on, as I go in to my room and break down in tears. I felt so excluded and humiliated. Ado-mom comes in and comforts me as I cry and question why they punish and target me for trying to be reasonable and nice. I see myself as a bit of an intellectual, but I am easily blinded my emotions. Once it was all out, I made my plans. They had wronged me. My bio-mom badmouths me as a mean to cover her own ass to look like a less shitty parent to the relatives. Apparently I wasn't worthy of the symbolic christmas gift. So Ado-mom and me make the moral uppercut. I add the aunts into a facebook messenger group and write ""Hello! Since I didn't come to celebrate up there with you, your gifts are still here. Where should we exchange gifts? Love L"". The key word is exchange. Now they have to sweat, knowing how they didn't bother to think about me, and they can't admit it to my face. So their attempt to be subtle and hurt me failed miserably, I hope, and I wish that they feel ashamed for their actions.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a dummy account to tell of this true story. Happened roughly 8 months ago and resulted in said manager getting fired and with criminal charges filed against them... 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, I previously worked at a multi-national retailers call centre for a couple years during university. When I got hired, I was immediately disliked by two (F) managers. I don't know if I said something while they were around for them to dislike me, but from the moment I started they were gunning for me... Constantly listening to my calls, citing me for silly mistakes I made, etc. It never really stopped but I sucked it up as I needed the money. This went on for about 2 years until it escalated one day...

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a security incident that occurred at work, they spent tens of thousands of dollars upgrading security at our office. This included about 30 new security cameras being installed. This will become prevalent shortly. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day when it was raining, 1 of the managers that disliked me slipped and sprained her foot. I was walking behind her and asked if she was okay. She didn't bother to answer me, so I kept walking to my car. Next day, she's not there. I get pulled into a meeting with HR who have said that the manager accused me of pushing her over, spraining her foot. I called bullshit straight away. HR were having no bar of it and fired me then and there. HR manager and this manager that slipped are very good friends, .so it wasn't worth fighting at the time so I reluctantly left and started to plot my revenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I skipped passed the union representative and called a family friend who's an attorney and we started to plot our payback. The police came to my flat the same day and asked me some questions. The manager had filed a police complaint against me. I told them to wait until my lawyer was present and I would disclose everything. He came over and I told the police everything that had happened. I did not push her, but that she slipped and there was proof of this... One of the new security cameras installed faced the direction where the manager had slipped. I told them to get the security footage and it would prove my innocence... It sure did!

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did the manager who filed a report against me get fired, her HR friend also got terminated from her position. Police charged the manager with filing a fake police report, and she got a $12,000 fine as well as a criminal conviction on her record. I filed a wrongful termination suit against the business and sued them for a hefty sum. I can't disclose the amount I received, but it was a life-changing amount for me. I then took the manager to court and sued her for defamation of character and emotional stress. I also got a nice payout from her. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're reading this, you know exactly who you are. Don't you ever think to fuck with people like that again. I hope you enjoy living in debt for the rest of your life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank-you for reading (if you're still here) lol.

So my classmate (let's call her Alex) stole my geography textbook on a Friday before exams started, because her book went missing. She even scratched my name out and wrote her own name, but it was obvious that the book was mine.
She also tried to cover it up, but failed pretty badly. Me, being a kind person, let her have it for the weekend. But as I went home, I wasn't happy with my kindness. So I decided to ""steal"" my book back on Monday. The geography exam was on Tuesday.

On Monday, when she went to the cafeteria during lunch break (we ate our lunch in the classroom, but you could go to the cafeteria to buy food), I took my geography textbook out of her bag, then gave it to one of my friends (let's call him John), because I knew Alex would suspect me of ""stealing her book"". And, when we were going home, I told John to give my book back (without Alex knowing). The plan worked.

When Alex found out ""her"" book went ""missing"", she started fake crying about how she was going to fail the geography exam. Apparently, she didn't even study geography during the weekend. I tried my best not to smile.

Also, I told another one of my friends too (let's call him Steve). I found out later (after the geography exam finished) that Alex had a crush on Steve, and since I told Steve, Steve now hates Alex. This is when I feared I went too far.

On the bright side, Alex finally decided to stop trying to cover such an obvious thing up. She then apologized to me, and told me I went too far. Apparently, she stole my book because she didn't want to fail, and she guessed that I would pass (since I usually score high marks). She also told me that she is really guilty. So yeah, that's my story.

TL;DR Classmate stole my geography textbook, I ""steal"" it back and tell two of my friends. Turns out that one of them is my classmate's crush, and hates my classmate now.

I am a 16 year old guy who has severe mental and physical problems because of the asshole in this story.

I was 4 1/2 years old when my parents got devorsed. I stayed with my mom my 3 brothers. 2 months later my mom got together with a asshole named Tim. 

At first he was nice but he soon showed his true colors. He started to beet us for the smallest things. And one time i messed up and he sexual abused when my mom was at her work. And then told me if i told anyone he would kill my family. Thats a good thing to tell a 5 year old. He then also had a kid with my mom.

My mom broke up with him on cristmas. You would think my mom would get my little brother, but no. Everyone in the county knew tim and his family and sided with him in chort for my little brother. And for a year they shared having him. Around the end of this year of insanity they git together again.

He continued to beat us and hurt us when our mom was not home. And he even sexually abused me again and told my the same thing as last time.

The pain and beatings continued. And when i was 10 we moved to a new apartment. The abuse got worse from there. One time i was thrown across the kitchen for forgetting to throw away 1 empty can of beer. 2 months after i turned 11 he woke me up in the middle of the night and sexually abused me again and said the same thing again. 

In may of that year he told me something that motivates me to do what i do. He told me ""it would be better if you killed myself."" He told that to a 11 year old kid. Thankfully im rebellious and now i live to keep others from killing themselves. 

2 weeks later he went on a rampage and beat my mom. My older brother called the cops. And tim tried to say that it was my mother who trasted the apartment and that he hurt her to stop her. Luckly their were 5 witness to back up my mom. We ended up moving away to my gandmas house later that summer.

But thats not Tim's assholeness ends. He ends up making my mom stay in the same city as him or he would take my littlest brother. And for 2 years my mom had to go from my grandmas house to where we lived before. But finale 2 years ago he beat his own son and my own brother. And tried to blamed it on a fake bully.

Hes in jail for one more year and will still have to what 2 more years to even see my littlest brother under police watch. 

My revenge has been whispering in the ears of the one around him. Making tim loss trust of the one around him. He has lost the trust of his family, his new girlfriend, his bosses, and his landlord. So when he does get out of jail he will have nowhere to go. No one to help him.

She would constantly abuse my mom, who was her younger sister, by demanding that she be her slave. ""Fetch me the water"" or ""go buy me lemonade"", all of the time. When my mom didn't comply, she responded by either shaming her on social media or beating her (crazy, right). My mom knew that it would all be over in a few years, so she let my demon of an aunt insult her and beat her - just becoming a servant in my aunt's eyes.

A college degree and a few years later, my mom meets my dad and they have my brother and I. During this time, my aunt didn't get into college because of her stupidity and couldn't hold down a job, because she thought all of her colleagues were there for helping her. She also has a child. I feel sorry for him, knowing all of the abuse he must have received. Anyway, the only time our aunt called us was to tell us how she felt entitled to receiving ""her money"". Pathetic.

Skip forward a few years again, and my brother's 10th birthday is approaching. He is really excited about it, and decides to invite everyone in the family (our parents tried concealing what kind of a person our aunt was). All the family puts money into buying a laptop for him, which he was really excited about because he loved video editing, and getting his laptop was a dream come true. So, our aunt, (EA) and her kid (EK), as well as the rest of the family, arrive for the party.

After making a snide remark about my mom's appearance, EA comes inside. We have a nice lunch, and the time for opening the presents arrived. We had all noticed EA had not bothered with a gift. The look of joy on my brother's face when he opened the laptop was priceless. As you can guess, it wouldn't last. EK starts throwing a fit, demanding the computer and trying to snatch it from my brother. My brother decides to let go so that EK can see the computer. Critical error. The laptop flies out of EK's hands and is destroyed. My brother cannot retain himself, so he decides to cry in his room, as he had loved the idea of getting a laptop.

EA: It's not such a big deal - just a stupid laptop the spoiled brat should've given to EK. EK is so well behaved, such a nice boy.
Dad: That laptop cost a lot of money. Are you going to reimburse it?
EA: Heck no! It's your son's fault he didn't let my poor EK play with it. Doesn't he have a right to have fun?
Dad: He has a right to not getting his property destroyed! He had been looking forward to it so much, and you defend EK?
EA: No one cares about his feelings, the little crybaby. Your children are disgusting and no one cares about them. EK has lots of friends, though. Also, you're irrelevant - I have more Facebook friends than you do!
Mom: At least he can hold down a good job. At least his friends like him!

EA starts hurling abuse and is about to SLAP my mom, when dad, grandpa and I escort her outside. No apology. Fine. When our brother was comforted and the other guests had left, we started to plot our revenge. My mother had had enough and contributes fully to the plan that would land her sister in prison. I remembered her mentioning her facebook clout, and so I checked it out to try and dig up some dirt. Oh, and how much dirt I found. Apparently, EA had been faking needing a wheelchair, probably for some monetary benefits.

So, we do the obvious thing - we pretend to be an association helping the disabled. We ask EA if she is disabled, and, after she corrects her initial no, she tells us she is. We are recording the conversation, and we can clearly hear her high heels walking down the street. We ask her where she is right now, and, after stuttering a bit, she lies by telling us she is at home.

We then compile all of the evidence we need. Photos, videos recorded after her ""accident"" of her not needing a wheelchair. With the help of social media (she is not the brightest tool in the shed), we find all of what we need. We had decided to go after 3 things: 1) her social life, 2) her career and 3) her child. Part 1: Her social life.

Remember her bragging about her Facebook friends? Well, these facebook friends had no idea that she was faking a disability for monetary benefits. We talk to every single one of them, sending them detailed evidence of what she was faking, how she was doing it and for what. 2 weeks later, her number of friends had decreased from 1k+ to 50. I was later told that her closest friends left her, not wanting to be associated with someone who would stoop so low as to fake a disability for some extra cash.

So, with little else to do (she didn't have any hobbies, talking about herself to her friends was her main pass time), she threw herself into work. She started making up for the poor work ethic and all of the insults she had distributed. 2 months in, once we were sure she had poured her life and soul into this new project, we called her manager.

He was very pleased with her progress up to a week ago, where she had apparently made a mistake. He was willing to forgive her because she was trying so hard. Perfect. So, we casually say that she is going to a rave this weekend (we offered EA free tickets for this, and she had accepted the invitation like a fool). We told the manager to be there. He thought that it was impossible, since she was in a wheelchair. We know, we told him.

So, we told him to arrive 15 minutes early and to go to this spot we had identified. EA arrives, insults us and tells her about how amazing she is. The manager sees her without a wheelchair. The conversation that ensued was the most hilarious thing:
M: Having some fun, are we?
EA: Sure! Want to dance?
M: You look oddly... tall.
EA: (still not realising) I'll show you my moves. You're always so grumpy at work (she was drunk) and you need to relax!
M: Firing you will be all I need to keep my mind at peace. How dare you fake a disability? Are you really that terrible a human?
EA's face suddenly turns from happy to horrified, as she realises she ""forgot"" to bring her wheelchair. She tries to bs her way out of this, but the manager is having none of it.

We learn from a very angry manager the next day that, not only has she been fired, but he had blacklisted her. The only industry she had some skills in, she couldn't work in. So, we had taken her friends and career. It was now time to rescue her child. We knew that if she beat up our mom when she was young, she probably beat her son. So, we invite him for a playdate at the aqua park. Although she hates us, she wants us to pay for her son's happiness. We see the bruises on his ribcage. When we confront him about it, he says his mom sometimes gets angry with him and hits him.

We call child protective services, who immediately respond. They take both EA and EK in for some questions, only to find that EA was on heroin. They took EK away from her, as they obviously deemed that that environment was unsafe for a child. The kid is nice, but was raised terribly by his mother. He jumps from foster family to foster family until we offer to keep him. We teach him the importance of being nice, and he became a nice brother. We get on very well nowadays.

All of this is happening while EA is on trial for domestic abuse, possession of heroin and harassment (some colleague complaining about EA's abuse of her). We were asked to testify, and testify we did. We attended the trial, got EA convicted and saved her child. The look on my mom's face when she heard her sister would be rotting in prison for 5 years was amazing. EA is now in her fourth year of jail, and I do not regret a second of putting such a terrible human being in jail.

TL;DR: My horrible aunt bullies my sister for their childhood, and is a pain to everyone who knows her. Her kid &amp; her ruin my brother's birthday party by breaking his expensive laptop, so we dig up some dirt on her to find out she has been faking a disability. We compile a lot of proof and send it to her friends and her boss, getting her ghosted, fired &amp; blacklisted in her industry. We then saved her child from her abuse &amp; her drugs, and took him in. He is now safe and happy.

Now, on the first day of school, he seemed like a likable guy. He was nice, and helped us out. But on the second day of school, he changed. He gave us 5 pages of homework, each with about 10 questions on it. He also graded the homework very seriously, and unlike **every other class,** he would grade it based on how many questions you got correct, not on effort. When I got the homework back, I got bad grade. I was confused, as I got the answers straight from the textbook. When I told him about this, he said that there was no way that he graded it wrong. I even showed him the page, but he insisted that he was correct. When he did the same thing again, and I told him about it, he **screamed** at me. When I say scream, I mean his face turned red and the vein in his forehead popped. He would do this to all the boys in his class when they do so much as sit the wrong way. Not only this, but he would also fall asleep during student presentations and then fail us all. He would also bring alcohol in a diet coke bottle to school, and drink from it every day, getting drunk in class. While this couldn't be proven, it would explain why he slurred his words and would lose his balance a lot and fall asleep.

He would do this every day for the entire year. He would assign homework over the breaks, even though he is technically not allowed to do that. That with him being creepy towards the females in the class, and him being biased towards the females too, everybody's resentment of him built up.

It reached a point in the year where nobody wanted him as a teacher anymore. And me, being the little schemer that I was, had a plan.

I recorded his behavior on my phone, through my sweater pocket so that he couldn't see it. Everybody was in on it, nobody told him because we all wanted him fired. The other students who tried to get him in trouble before us never recorded him for some reason. I got **dozens** of videos of him staring at the female students, shouting at the males, and falling asleep during class. Not only this, but I also took one of his diet coke bottles and went to the guidance counselor. I showed her everything, and she confirmed that it was indeed alcohol inside the coke bottle. I sent the videos to her and she kept the coke bottle.

The next day, he wasn't in school and there was a substitute. The vice principal came down to our classroom and questioned my entire class, and they all confirmed what I had said to the guidance counselor. After the period was over, he informed us that he had been fired on the spot. Not only that, but his teaching license was revoked, and his wife was filing for divorce for separate reasons. (I don't even know how he managed to get married in the first place.)

She told me this story one time when we were driving home from WalMart. I was in high school at the time, but she told me this story on how she dealt with bullying when she was younger. She told me this story as I have been brutally bullied throughout msot of my time in grade and high school. I want to preface this pro revenge is a little different from your usual as my mother took a direct approach to handling a bully. 

So this was when she was in the third grade and the boy that picked on her was in the same grade as her but bigger than her. At the time, my mother was called Blue by the other kids as she always wore a Blue dress or something Blue with her outfits. She is still called this to this day by her friends from that time. (yes her friends in grade school are still her friends now with kids of their own.). This was roughly during late to early 70s. So this is a throwback. 

My mother had a bully by the name of Raymond.(Not his real name.) That would bully her every day and make fun of my mother nonstop with teasing and name calling. He also made fun of her home situation.(She was one of 9 kids). This reach a boiling point one day during spring time when he purposely tripped my mother and expose her undergarments for the rest of the class to see. This was very embarrassing and my mother went home to tell her mother what happened.(Her mother being my grand mother by the way.). She was crying.   


Basically she told her mother what happened and told her if he tries anything again she permission to beat him up. The next day at school, he slaps my mother up the side of the head. She slaps him back in the face and balls up a fist saying, ""Me and you 3:30 outside of the school. We're going to settle this.""   


Yeah, I know this is very old school. Usually kids these days will try and jump a kid when they're not looking. But this is back in the days, so things were different. Anyway, at 3:30 went down both met up with their friends serving as witness. They start to fight and it is a pretty even match as both my mother and Raymond brawl from outside of their grade school to a few blocks near her house. It was back and forth but my mom was holding her odd. They got close to a nearby vacant house and Raymond tries to tackle my mother into the wall. My mother goes low and tosses him over her head into the window. It breaks on impact and the kids lose their minds at what they just witnessed. They all book it as my mother just walks home with her friend after that with a bloody lip. Word spread fast around the school that, ""Blue toss Raymond through the window!"" My mother gained a lot respect among her peers for that and the Raymond left her alone after that. Years later he still brings it up with my mother telling her that was a wake up call for him to stop acting bad. No cops were called as my mom's mom talked to Raymond's mother about what was going on. She let it slide as Raymond didn't suffer bad injuries from being toss into a window and learned his lesson not to bully girls.   


I was jsut blown away by this story and got it confirmed from her other friends at the time and Raymond, the bully, himself. Man things were very different back then. I'm happy Raymond turned his life around after that. I know he's still alive as he came to my mother's 50 birthday a few years back.

Afterwards he was impolite, pushed the responsibility to another department, offerred no help at all, and dismissed my case by giving me their corporate customet service number that was a hassle to get through.

Next week, I'm going to go to his office again with some imaginary problem inquiry, with my real goal is getting his full name and maybe a business card if possible. A quick search on google should give me all the info I need. I'm going to curse him.

[CO] Business was stealing my photos, I used their own algorithm to flood their Facebook page with pornography.

Both myself and the business who stole my photos are located in Colorado, specifically the Boulder area. Also I apologize if algorithm isn't the right word, I'm not super tech savvy.

I found a business who was stealing my (former professional, now part-time freelance photographer) photos from my Instagram page, for their Facebook page. I reached out numerous times, but never with a lawyer, and they always promised to remove my photos and to ensure it didn't happen again. This has been going on for about 6 months.

Looking through my photos and the photos on their page, I realized they're using an algorithm or program of some sort to automatically download Instagram photos with a specific combination of hashtags, and to automatically post them on their Facebook page (without credit, if that's relevant). Over the weekend I had the idea to use a bunch of bogus Instagram accounts over the course of a couple days to upload a large number of softcore and hardcore pornography pics to Instagram, with the specific combination of hashtags. Most got removed almost immediately by Instagram, but at least 10 of these pictures were picked up by their program and uploaded to their Facebook page.

I've since been messaged by the company on my Instagram (I assume they're assuming I had something to do with it since I've been regularly sending them takedown letters), threatening to sue me for loss of revenue, the spreading of lewd material, and the sabotage of a business.

It's sat on about an acre to 2 acres of land with some impressive cast iron fencing all the way around. Think the Rosewood Manor (fictional mansion from a horror made-for-tv movie) on a smaller scale. 

Fast forward to when I was 17, by this point my friends knew that this would be the place to find me if they couldn't locate me anywhere else in town. I heard a car coming up the long drive to the property and didn't even bother turning around as I just assumed it was one of my friends. turns out it wasn't one of them. It was the little old man who owns the property

I won't go into details about what I said before realizing it wasn't someone I knew. But let's just say the old guy got a pretty good kick out of how sheepish I became after calling him a few expletives in a rather friendly manner. 

So after a couple minutes of conversation telling him how much I admire the place he invites me inside to help him with some of the yearly chores he does around the property. 

Skipping ahead to when I'm 23, by this point I had already been the one doing the majority of the upkeep on the place on a monthly basis and was eventually told that if I wanted the house and property it was mine. 

Excited Screaming. 

That same day we had the paperwork drafted up and notarized and I began to move in.

It was like a fantasy come true. I had the home of my dreams and a lovely location. 

Now, skip ahead again to when I'm 28. The old man has died and I am sent reeling from it. About three weeks after the funeral I wake up to cows filling my property and an eviction notice, handwritten and stapled to the front door. 

It was the grandson of the old guy claiming that the property was now his and I had two weeks to get the hell out. Oh, hell no.

I call the phone number at the bottom of the eviction notice and ask what all this is about. In not-so-nice of terms, he told me that the property was rightfully his by the original will drafted up by his great-great-grandfather being the only living blood heir to the land so I wasn't welcome anymore. 

I informed him that his grandfather had given the property to me, and I even have paperwork to prove it. He hangs up. No further contact via phone or text or anything though I tried. 

During the next two weeks I had Windows broken, property destroyed, the fence damaged almost to the point of beyond repair, windows busted out.

Last summer, my friend caught his now ex-wife cheating. 

We all lived in an apartment complex and knew each other well. My friend (26) is a really good manager at a retail store and makes enough to pay the bills and still have money leftover. The Wife (27) works an admin job. They've been together for 6 years, married for 2.

His wife, while secretive, seemed like a very kind woman. She apparently met a guy online, got her girl-boner going, and set up a fuck session at a hotel.

It happened with the some ""I'm going to dinner with the girls"" excuse and my friend's intuition kicked in that something was wrong.

So, he calls me over and asks what he should do. Me thinking this was no big deal, I tell him to just snoop through her social media if it's bugging him that much. He does, and FB wasn't holding back. The messages I read would tear me apart but my friend kept his composure, screen-capped as much as he could and asks if we can go to their hotel.

I grab my cousin because I had a feeling things might get physical and we drive 30 minutes to the hotel. He gets out, tells us to follow him and we get to the lobby.

My friend walks up to the guy at the front desk and tells him the whole truth. There were better ways to do it but the truth was enough for the front desk to call up the room with the wife and ask her to come down and clear up any misconception.

When she comes down the elevator, she sees us and stops like a deer caught in the headlights. Casually walking up to us and trying to play it off with the ""it's not what it looks like"". 

He falls to his knees and starts sobbing and begging her to ""come back"", ""what did I do wrong"". In front of everyone. In the lobby. Where everyone was staring.

I'm thinking this is real, so I tried pulling him away from her while saying: ""She's not even worth it, you can do better than her."" I'm flustered because this was my first time experiencing something like this and I was basically doing what I thought was right at the time.

Everyone was staring us all down by the time we manage to drag him away. She obviously tried following us, apologizing and other BS until my cousin had enough. He snaps and yells at her, yelling: ""Haven't you hurt him enough?"" (Paraphrasing but it had enough of an effect to make the Wife go ""oh shit"" and cry.)

We drive back to the complex and I set him up in my apartment. My mom was cool with it and gave him the couch. (She works nights so she's cool with anything as long as I don't make too much noise.)

Almost an hour later, his in-laws show up trying to figure out why their daughter is freaking out. He sits them down on our dinner table and tells them EVERYTHING and even showed them the screen-caps of her bad-mouthing him.

They were obviously mortified and quietly left after some time. Later on, I discovered that they disowned her. (I learned that the in-laws had both dealt with a cheating ex in the past. Yikes.)

He asks if we can play videogames to keep him distracted. We do, and play 2k.

His Wife eventually shows up, banging on the door, sobbing, and begging for forgiveness. He didn't want to open it but she was creating such a scene that the neighbors came out to figure out what's going on.

They get her side of the story and come up to our door and ask us what's going on. She tells them more BS about how she's being misunderstood (lol). My friend didn't say anything, just sent them screen-caps before locking himself in the bathroom. 

My mom, pissed off, kicks everyone out except me and my friend who was still in the bathroom.

He stayed for the weekend, and Sunday was dead quiet. Monday comes around, and Wife tries talking to him again. This time however, he invites her in but my friend was cold and straight to the point. He wants an amicable divorce. She, obviously, was devastated. 

His reasoning was that he trusted her with everything and she burned it all away. Nothing can rekindle their relationship and it hurts just looking at her.

I don't know how he managed it but he pulls it off without a hitch.

Everything gets processed, and trying to maintain the good guy image, he helps her move all her stuff to a storage unit, and pays for a month's rent at a motel and they go their seperate ways.

Now that everything was over, he calls me back to his almost empty apartment and tells me the truth. He already knew that she was cheating and wanted everyone to hate her before getting the divorce. I don't know if all of it was an act because he was crying for a while but he did have a malicious intent to ruin in some kind of way.

Well, he got exactly what he wanted. I felt a little betrayed but he owed up to it, apologized, and bought me and my mom a cake for our birthdays. So now we're cool and mom enjoys having him around on her days off.

Right now, he's with another woman he met a couple months later that seems pretty chill and funny. They've only been together for at least 5 months and they've been doing everything together and seem very happy. (She actually came to me one time and asked me to help surprise him. Something the other one never did.)

So here's hoping he'll be in a well-deserved happy relationship!

Oh, and to add a little salt in the wounds, he tells me that if he ever gets engaged to her, he plans on telling everyone that the divorce was the best thing to have ever happen to him.

My family and I emigrated to the US when I was 7, and for the first 3 months we were here we lived with a relative of my mom’s who emigrated a few years before us. The dad helped my dad going to interviews, walked him buying a car and helped us find our bearings in the US.

My family and I are Buddhist and this family are solidly Fundamentalist Christians. While we lived with them, they strongly encouraged us to go to church with them every Sunday and when they tried to keep us going to church with them. when my family found a temple and started attending that temple, they started treating us like shit.

Their sons would pick on me and make fun of my English and told me I won’t go to college and probably just end up being a repair man. The mom and their daughter would make fun of my sister for her rapid weight loss and gains. When we found out later this was due to lupus and she had to be hospitalized, they told my mom that the reason my sister is sick is because we worship “demons”.

About 15 years ago, the dad lost his job. My parents who were now doing well, needed to re-tile the house, hired the dad to do it and when I asked how much they were charged I was floored thinking they miscalculated, I told them they were overpaying but my dad just said, we’re paying them back.

This happened again, every home improvement project my dad did, he would always hire the dad and would always be overcharged. The shitty thing is, the work was beyond sub-par, like the re-tiling work, I had to re grout the entire job when I visited one holiday. On top of this they would always ask to borrow money and never paid my dad back.

At this point I figured my parents paid them back and then some. Frankly I was completely done with them when I heard what they said about my sister. One day, I get a wedding invitation, their middle son is getting married. Not wanting to have anything to do with them, I RSVP no. about a month later I got a call from their mom asking why I haven’t sent a gift yet.

She demanded i sent a gift despite my protest I am not obligated to, then she mentioned how my family owed them and she knew I can afford to send gifts because I had a well paying job and how she always prayed for us to be saved. When she said this it trigger the wheels in my brain to turn and I told her, she's right I was being rude I will send a gift.

When I hung up I immediately looked up every Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Jain, Sikh, Zoroastrian houses of worship in their area and made a donation in the happy couple’s name. Then I also donated to the Satanic Temple and bought the ENTIRE FAMILY membership cards and certificates to the Satanic temple.

About 2/3 weeks later I got a call again from the mom, I answered as politely as I can ""Oh Hi did you enjoy the gift?"" This was met with a barrage of yelling, screeching and a torrent of insult. I was barely able to make anything out.

The daughter called my sister and the middle son called me later demanding an explanation I flat out told him everything and was 100% non-apologetic about it, actually I did say I was sorry for not being there to see the whole thing go down.

When I spoke to my sister later, this is what we’re able to piece together. They had the wedding shower at their church after services. And they were opening their gifts then. Well they got to my gift; everyone was uncomfortable seeing all the donations to the houses of worship with definitely non-Christian names made in the couple’s names. Then the bride’s parents flipped out when they saw the membership cards and certificate with the family’s name on it and they freaked out even more when they saw the Bride’s membership card.

They bride’s parents demanded she break off the engagement and she did. Every one in their church apparently thinks the whole family are Satanist trying to corrupt their church, and they are treated as pariahs in their church. Now people are telling them they’re going to hell. I ran into the mom and dad a few weeks ago at the market and I look at them raised the Satan hand gesture (Index finger and pinky extended, middle and ring finger tucked and thumb folder over them). They scurried away from me.

Was I an asshole for doing it, yeah no debate there, but I figure, with how much I donated, I don’t think anyone can call me ungrateful, or say it’s a cheap wedding gift.

This is the story of how I got my revenge against the worst man I’ve ever met and certainly ever dated.

About 10 years ago I started college out of state, I lived in the “party dorms” of a relatively large state school and as a consequence was dragged to sorority recruitment by my friend group from my floor. I didn’t wanna go, had no interest in Greek life past using frats for free alcohol, but my neighbor paid my registration fee and told me she’d smoke me out after just so we could all go together. Turns out I found a sorority I fit in really well with, the girls were not typical blonde blue eyed ditzy southern belles w fake pearl necklaces from michaels- there were more girls in the agriculture school than in communications or business and most of them could out drink and smoke anyone. I loved it, ended up drifting away from my freshmen group and diving head first into Greek life- both in regards to leadership positions and parties. Every night of the week I was at a different frat, my favorite one was our direct neighbors. There I met the man that would ruin my life. 6’4” and over 300lbs he was hard to miss, and his personality filled the room. Everyone loved him, he hated me. Don’t know what I did but he refused to speak to me or even look in my direction for months. 

One day he just switched it up and decided to befriend me. I won’t lie, in college I got on well with the guys Bc I was pretty and loved to party but I don’t think I was stuck up, so I was confused Bc I had never really encountered anyone that didn’t like me instantly up until that point. Yes I know how annoying this sounds now. 

By the end of my freshmen year were dating- and I mean I’m spending every night at his house and cooking him food type of dating. I did everything for him. I don’t know why. Over summer break I drove the four hours to his subleased apartment in a different city just because he told me to. He told me he loved me, and I believed him. Over the course of my time in the Greek system I began drinking- a lot- and abusing Xanax- a lot. Around my sophomore year I realized it was a problem and stopped pills of my own volition and tapered my alcohol consumption. However I noticed that even though I was drinking less I was still blacking out and waking up with bruises I didn’t remember the origins of. It wasn’t until the end of my 3rd year that I realized what was happening. 

My boyfriend at the time and I were constructively living together. At parties I rarely left his side. I went to his classes. It wasn’t that I wanted to be with him but I had nobody else to hang out with- at least nobody meaningful. All my connections were strictly surface level as my bf would cut people off who would voice how weirdly demanding he was and how co-dependent I was. At some point he asked if we could try rougher sex. I initially said yes but immediately implemented our safe word when he started choking me. A week or so later I woke up after a party I knew I had only had three beers at with no recollection, in my boyfriends bed completely naked and bruises all around my neck. I don’t know why I was so sure with so little evidence but I’ve never been so certain of anything else in my life than the fact that my boyfriend had been periodically drugging and raping me for god knows how long. 

I couldn’t confront him immediately and risk being manipulated into letting him continue so I devised a plan. That next weekend I watched my drink like a hawk, purposely setting it down next to my boyfriend and keeping an unopened beer in my hoodie pocket for when I got back. I switched the two drinks out and did my best impression of a wasted sorority girl. I heard my boyfriend fake complain to his friends about how he had to take me home *again*, them joke around in a way that confirmed this was typical and him cart me off into his bedroom at a quieter house down the road. Starfished on his bed, I laid there in terrified silence while he methodically stripped me naked and flipped me around to a position I never ever consented to while sober. After he slapped me a few times and started setting up to rape me I had enough evidence. At that point I did something I’m not proud of to stop him. I tried to force myself to pee the bed, the pressure also made me shit myself. It took everything in me to not burst out laughing when he realized what happened and started cursing me and flipping out, especially considering he had to clean everything up because he was under the impression he had drugged me into a comatose state. 

I woke up in the bathtub and groggily asked him what happened, I played the remorseful and dutiful girlfriend. I washed his sheets and replaced his mattress cover all while planning my long term revenge. He collected very expensive hand blown worked bongs. They were anywhere from $300 for a bubbler to over a thousand for a larger bong. The glass art on them is what made them unique. They were also very fragile. The next time I was alone I set about making small cracks in the pieces that would either eventually break through normal wear and tear and render the pieces unsmokeable or worthless- about 6k worth of damage. Then I went into every account I could think of and changed the passwords. I poked holes in all of his air sealed weed storage bags and jars, I went through his vinyl collection and put records in different sleeves with no sense or reason (about 200 records). After my petty side was satisfied I went about ruining his personal and professional life. I sent lewd emails to his fraternity headquarters from his school email that eventually got him kicked out. I called in an anonymous tip to his employer (a finance internship) that got his entire team of interns drug tested- which he failed and lost the promise of post graduate employment with them. I supported him through all this as much as I could (emotionally, I didn’t let him touch me anymore.) eventually I told him that he repulsed me and I was breaking up with him because of his body. I didn’t mind the way he looked, I just knew it would hurt the most. 

I’m not proud of the way I broke up with him but short of slitting his throat, it was the most painful way I could think of breaking him. Last I heard he had gained 100lbs and hasn’t had a gf or made use of his diploma in the 6 years since we broke up. I’m happily married and own my own business making over six figures. He calls me periodically and leaves messages telling me i’m the best thing he’s ever had and he wishes he could go back to the times we spent together.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,920891,public,self,"Date rape me and reap what you sow, it’ll be the last happiness you feel",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/ezhcqc/date_rape_me_and_reap_what_you_sow_itll_be_the/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I guess this is more my mom’s story than mine, but I was involved. It’s about how I got my sister. I’ll call myself Sara and my friend Alex.





Since middle school, I have been best friends with Alex. It all started with us being paired for a project, and we did great together! I struggled often in school, so my parents were so happy. So I invited her to eat lunch with my group of misfit friends. She was an outcast, too. From then on, she would help me with any schoolwork I needed, and I would help her with math. See, I wasn’t born in America, and my family immigrated during a critical period in my language development, so I needed anything and everything I wrote for classes proofread and edited. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased we moved for my mom’s career- she became basically Dr. Cuddy to our small town hospital and clinic- but that sort of move isn’t all roses.






Alex was great at improving my written work. Even my parents loved her, because they saw my grades go up as she helped me, and she was always respectful and quiet. A Good Influence.






We quickly became best friends, so much so that everyone at school tended to refer to us in one breath as “AlexandSara.” The only classes we ever had differently were AP English for her, regular for me, and our language classes. She took one and I took the other.






I still feel bad about not figuring out what was going on earlier. But Alex was the brainy one, not necessarily me. Sure, there were hints. I’m pretty sure it’s not normal for your friend to eat half your kitchen when she comes over, or my having to sneak her breakfast and other extras. But I just thought it was a weight thing. Alex’s mom was a rail thin athlete, who also thought it was important for her kids to be bilingual. It’s hard to know what’s going on when you don’t even know a dozen words of said difficult foreign language. And we hardly ever went to Alex’s house anyway.






Over a period of the first three years I knew her, Alex slowly changed. It was nearly unnoticeable unless you knew her as well as I did, but she went from talkative and happy to withdrawn and...crushed. I don’t know how else to describe it. It was like cutting off oxygen to a fire. Her flame suffocated. She didn’t want to go swimming or play sports any more, wore jeans and long sleeves no matter the weather, and seemed perpetually exhausted. Toward the end, I swear she was losing weight, and was as white as notebook paper. Another funny thing was that she *never* cried.






I, I mean we, *tried*. But every time, Alex would insist everything was fine, no matter who or how asked her. Eventually I dropped the subject. I could tell she was getting annoyed with me.





One late winter day, it was weirdly warm. It’s cold where we lived then, so of course we went for a walk. The sunset bathed everything in red. We were out so long that it was nearly dark when we stumbled back.






Alex tripped or something. Partially melted ice is the worst, and it was right at the foot of the neighbors’ gravel driveway. Before I got there, she was already staggering to her feet again, so it can’t have been that bad.






“I just cleaned, so take off your shoes at- Alex, you’re bleeding,” my mom called, abruptly switching tack mid sentence, as we dragged mud inside.






“I’m okay. I just fell down in some gravel.” But one knee looked ruined, and there was a big scrape just above her elbow, already bleeding through the shirt.






“Let me-” mom insisted.






“*No!* I mean, no thank you.”






I caught a note of panic in Alex’s voice. Alex never panicked. Why now, over something so minor?






“Don’t be stupid. You might have some pieces of gravel embedded where you fell.” Alex flinched at the use of “stupid,” but she was four foot eleven and a hundred pounds if that at the time. No contest. My family’s unusually tall. It wasn’t hard for my mom and I to steer her, limping badly, into the kitchen.






I knew the routine from my mom treating a million childhood bumps and bruises, and went to get the massive first aid kit from the bathroom.







“Alex, hold still so I can-“ Then thirty seconds of the loudest silence I ever heard, just broken by the tap running, greeted me as I came back in.







“Sara, put it on the table. Alex, *breathe*. You’re panicking,” my mom finally said. Then I saw what made my friend finally lose her cool.







The parts of her arm not scraped raw were covered in a web of scars, some old, some fresh.







“Why didn’t you tell me?” I blurted out.







My mom told me sharply in our language to be quiet if I couldn’t help, told Alex it was okay, she wasn’t mad, we’ll discuss this after we finish patching you up. There were more scars on Alex’s legs, too.






Eventually, with lots of stopping and starting because she was crying so hard, we found out that Alex had been hurting herself for almost three years. She was always anxious. Everything had to be perfect for her mom. Even admitted, in a roundabout way, that said mom told her really cruel things, called her names, and didn’t like to give her enough to eat.






And of course, my mom had to tell her, hey, I’m going to tell whichever of your parents comes to pick you up tomorrow about this. So you can get help. “Better you than me. They’ll kill- I mean, be so angry then,” Alex, looking resigned, said.







I woke up to a raging argument the next morning. Couldn’t be my dad or brother- dad was abroad, brother already in college. No, this was a catfight. I went over to where Alex was sleeping and covered her ears. This was nasty. I recognized her mom’s voice. No, I won’t get her any help, she’s lying. Just being dramatic. Don’t listen to her. Don’t tell me how to parent.







Finally, my mom asked point-blank whether Alex’s mom would be pursuing any kind of treatment for her kid. Mommy Dearest said no, I get to choose medical care for my own kid, she’s only sixteen.






What happened next would have knocked me over if I hadn’t already been sitting down. I strained my ears and just caught, “...you’re right. It is your choice. But, I’m a mandated reporter due to my job, and you’ve just admitted you’re going to neglect your child’s serious medical problem. I put a tape recorder somewhere for this talk in case things got ugly. It would be a shame if someone reported you to CPS with evidence, you being a teacher and community figure…”







I jumped about eight feet in the air when Alex’s mom yelled back, “Are you *threatening* me?”







“Not at all, Mrs. X,” my mom said calmly. “What I’m saying is that if *you* don’t help Alex, *I* will. My family has grown to love her and we don’t want anything to happen. I have a form here that would allow me to make medical decisions for her, just temporarily. Sign it, leave her with us, and I won’t report you to CPS.”







There was more arguing, but my mom had clearly shifted the balance of power her way. I don’t know exactly how she did it, but she got the signature, and we kept Alex. I was so happy to finally, really get a sister, whatever the circumstances.







And Alex got better. It was really hard for her, but she made it in the end. After some time had passed, my parents, Alex’s parents, a mediator, and Alex’s stockbroker uncle all sat down together. See, Alex’s uncle had an education fund he was tending for her, and he was appalled to learn of his sister in law’s conduct.







By then, she was seventeen. It wasn’t too hard to pull the funds a year early and use them to pay for Alex’s portion of the family insurance premium, since they were furious about continuing to pay it. In return, her parents signed a temporary guardianship form. This extended my mom’s authority past medical decisions- it’s essentially the same form that lets host families of exchange students act as parents- into all major aspects, and let her sign forms as Alex’s guardian, so she could go on field trips again. There was even enough money, if she was careful, to put Alex through all of college and provide her with a small personal allowance until she graduated. Not that my parents couldn’t afford another person, but Alex was big on not being a burden.







My parents and I moved when I was 22, and even though it’s far away, Alex knows she can visit whenever she wants. Seeing her smiling and playing with my one year old son is really what made me think to write this story here. It’s not a perfect mean or funny revenge like many I see here. 






But my revenge is having my “sister” here. Alive. She still has some problems, and can’t work full time at the moment, but has a supportive spouse, a decent part time job, and volunteers at an animal rescue.

For reference: GF-girlfriend, GG-good guy, LS- Good guys little sister, LB- good guys little brother
So, obligatory not me, but a friend. He and his girlfriend had been dating since freshman year of high school. They were perfect together and there was nothing wrong with him, personality wise. He was loving and sweet, alwyas making sure his GF had what she needed/wanted. GF, on the other hand, refused to do anything for herself. For example, we had a test in Spanish class. The next day, we got them back and I got a perfect score. She asked me if she could copy it. She had taken her test home the day before so she could copy someones test the next day. We were all pretty sure she switched colleges and majors just so she could follow GG and copy his work.
Well, I recently found out from GG that GF had cheated on him with one of her exes, so he broke up with her. His family was devastated. LS down a week crying because she had gotten so close to GF. GF showed up at his house one night and drove off in their truck (both their names were on it amd they split the bill). He called her and told her to bring it back, or he was calling the cops. She brought the truck back and left. End of story, right?
Wrong. GF and her friend kept complaining to GG about not having the truck anymore. GF wanted the truck because 'its my truck and you have no right to keep it' and she needed it to go see her ex. GG, completely out of character, decided to give it to her. So he called GF and told her it would be at the closest gas station so she could come pick it up. He then got LS and LB and they destroyed the truck (slashed tires, ran the battery out, ran it out of gas, sugar in the gas tank, smashed the front and rear lights, ect.) GG then removed his name off the title of the truck, dropped it off at the gas station, and blocked GFs number. He told me, the way he figured, the cost of fixing the truck would be enough revenge for him because of all the money he spent on her.

The next day when I came to school the admin called me into her office and said that a student reported me selling ""child p\*\*\*"" to other students and now I am in the headmasters office typing this. The big mistake is that my back stabbing friend did is that he told me that he has a weapon in his bag so I told them that he made up the story and that he has a weapon. They searched his bag and arrested him because he is under age and he just got kicked out of the school today. I think getting ISS because ""I knew about the weapon"" and did not tell anybody was worth it.

TL;DR at the end

Sorry in advance for the spelling mistakes, English is not my first language but I will do my best.

For a little backstory, I am in an engineering school in France. The educational system is different than in other countries: to study engineering you don't go to university but you study in a private school. This is important because for the 3 first years of my studies, everyone studies the same subjects, pass the same exam, have the same project… etc. 

Also, the grading system is the following: grades ranging from 0 to 20 and you need 10/20 to pass.

&amp;#x200B;

The people involved in the story are the following:

* PP: Project Partner
* OF : Old Friend
* SA : Stupid Asshole
* Me… self-explanatory

&amp;#x200B;

**Here comes the story:** 

At the beginning of the second semester of my second year we get a small project in electronics. This project was fairly small comparing the time/work to the value it had on our final grade.

The task we were given was not hard but we have to work in VHDL, which we never used and never got any information on by the school: it’s the whole purpose of the project, to make us search by our self to learn how to use it. We had to work in pair so I decided to work with a friend in my class (PP): we were already worked together on project,  so we knew it will be alright. As in most informatic/ electronic project we have together, she hates to code and therefore is bad at it. So we agreed that I will to the code and technical stuff, and she will do the writing/presentation part.

We had couple hours in class to work on this project with a teacher. That guy had a reputation of being a prick, very severe when it comes to grading and not helping at all on the project. He was supposed to help us but didn’t do shit so everyone ended up struggling, losing time downloading the software needed, not having much information how to get started; we had lost most of our class time like this and were more or less alone to do it.

You should know is that my school has a VERY strict policy of not copying projects/not working with other groups, etc. Basically, we were told that if your code/delivery matched another code by more than 30% we would get a 0, basically sending you to the “retake” of the final exam as the project was so important it was impossible to catch up. The school has a very powerful bot to detect similarities with other projects.

After a difficult time to gather information online to get starting as VHDL is very weakly documented the project delivery date approached. I had done a pretty decent work and finished 2 days before the delivery. 

That’s where the trouble started...

It was my first year in this school as I changed school in between my 1st and 2nd year, retaking my second year. A friend of mine did exactly the same thing at the same moment: you guessed it, he is OF!

So OF and his project partner (SA) barely had a done anything on the project and were hoping on the generosity of a friend who could do the work for them. Little did they know no one wanted to give out their work to wankers like them as everyone was too afraid them copying too much and therefore get a 0/20.

As you would expect, OF went to me and I took pity of him (he is a good friend after all, I didn't want to be a prick) so I helped them to get started, not showing nor sharing my work, just giving them tips and website giving them instruction on what to do. SA came back to me couple of times to ask me things about the project. I didn’t think much of it I found him to be a nice guy so I often answered his questions. It’s important to know that I was still working on the project on my computer at the time to try to improve my code and prepare to present my work.

Fast forward to couple month after, me and my partner did great at the presentation and we finally got our grade for that project. And here, it was a mess for everyone… including us.

It took about 3 month to get it graded as the school didn’t realize when they gave us this project that you basically had only one way to do it right. The code being so short, about 80% of the students initially got struck for copying by the bot and would have had 0/20. In the end they only decided to give 6/20 to anyone who supposedly worked with another group. 

To my surprise I got a 6/20 and decide to go and see the school's teacher in charge to complain. (This is important) I guaranty them I work alone, I never shared my code with anyone and I don’t see why I have this grade. The teacher insists to know if I shared or copy my project which I reply again I had done nothing of that. I get out, after she told me she will see about it and contact the teacher who graded us.

The day after, I get an email from her telling me a group of student from a class I’m not in had a 98% match with my code. Only now I understand what happened. SA and OF must have stolen my project’s code somehow and I am in trouble because of it. From what I know right now, they either sneaked behind me to take photos of my code when I has working in a classroom (the code was hard but very short so almost everything could fit on the screen) or copied it when I got away from my computer (I play very regulary foosball so I take a lot of breaks there with friends) 

I go back to the administration to tell them I think I know what happened but I had no proof. She asks OF and SA to come but they naturally deny, telling I gave them my project and they didn’t steal it otherwise they would risk to be expelled from the school.

SA had stolen my project, told OF that I gave it to him and proceeded to delivery it without changing anything.  

My partner and I were furious, especially because our grade downed to 0/20 as it wasn’t considered working together anymore but giving project away. The administration didn’t like the fact that I lied to them telling I worked alone when to them I gave my project away.

&amp;#x200B;

**Time for the revenge!**

At this point, we were right after our final exams, I knew I would have to retake my final exam in elctronics to pass it and so will SA, OF and unfortunatly PP was dragged into this as well. 

I knew they almost never went to any lectures during the year so they barely had any notes from any subjects. They again, were planning on the generosity of some people to just hand them their notes.

Unfortunatly for them, I made sure for the previous weeks to spread my story as much as possible and so did my friends to destroy SA and OF’s reputation. I didn’t want to do much about it at first because I didn’t want to harm OF but my friends convinced me of doing my best to destroy them as they got me in trouble and I shouldn't let this slide. Luckily for me a lot of my close friends were in SA and OF’s class and convinced everyone to do not give them any notes. I knew at this point OF had 3 subjects to retake and SA had 4 and they would have to work a lot to pass their year: they only had about 10 days before the retake exams day.

The story spread in the school and at some point a lot of people knew about it, in the end no one helped them.

They both logically fail their year, lost 9000€ (10,000$) worth of a year in the school, lost their international exchange. 

OF left the school as he couldn’t afford more money in his studies and went to university.

SA is despised by a lot of people and has a bad reputation, he stayed in the school. 

I still feel bad for OF but he wasn’t working and would have failed either way.

I passed year passing all of my subjects so did my PP. But still got in trouble for lying to a member of the administration and to this day, they still don't believe me.

He was pretty cool but picky beyond belief and couldn't decide on what he wanted.

Finally though he ordered this ultra deluxe, 4 player arcade machine wrapped in Star wars graphics, I don't have the original pic so here's a sample render he spared no expense, spending $3000 plus $220 shipping.

The machine arrives in Melbourne 5 days later and he calls me up losing his shit. It's been damaged by the freight company. I send everything fully insured so I assured him it was ok, he's covered. Please send me the pics of the damage.

It was only very slight, nothing cosmetic, but the console was a little dislodged as they must have stacked something heavy on it.

I assured the customer it could be fixed, I'll contract a cabinet maker to come out to him and repair it at my expense, then I'll go through insurance later.

Nope. he didn't want that.

So i said ok, I'll arrange for collection and have it brought back to me, and I'll issue him a full refund including freight.

Nope. He didn't want that either.

Ok I said, what would make you happy then? It's something easy to fix, perhaps i can pay you what I'd pay the contractor (about $250) and you can fix it?

Nope. He wanted a full refund AND he wanted to keep the machine too.

I said that won't happen. Insurance won't allow it as the damage is tiny. It's like car insurance, they won't write off a whole car for minor damage that can be fixed.

He didn't care, he wanted a refund.

I said they won't do it, and I certainly wont pay out of pocket. Either I'll arrange collection of the unit at my expense and issue a refund to him or we have it repaired.

Nope. He paid via Paypal and he's putting through a dispute because the item ""didn't arrive as described"". I advised him that Paypal's rules also state that in order to get a refund, He'll need to show proof that he'd sent the item back or arranged with the sender to have it collected.

Nope. He's keeping it and getting a refund.

So I advised him that what he was committing was fraud and theft, Also Paypal will freeze the $3220 in my account and I'm not at fault here. That's what Paypal does you see. If anyone lodges a dispute, they automatically freeze the funds in the sellers account. it's guilty until proven innocent with them. It can also take up to 90 days to resolve, sometimes 6 months. I know, it's happened before.

He didn't care. The next thing i knew, I had a notification from Paypal. The funds were frozen pending the dispute.

The next step is stating your case to them. Providing evidence etc where they relay the info back and forth between the buyer and seller. Paypal ALWAYS sides with the buyer, sellers are a piece of shit as far as they're concerned. If it cant be resolved between buyer and seller, then you can opt to have Paypal decide. but their decision is absolute.

I provided my transcripts advising the customer that I'd collect the item and refund him, and he provided them with a fake pick up receipt. As far as they knew, he's done his part, now he's eligible. So they ruled in his favour.

So this fucker now has his money back and my $3000 machine. I was fuming, and he wouldn't answer my calls or emails. I'm a big guy and i had a rough upbringing in a tough neighbourhood, so i was about to jump into my truck, drive the 900km south, knock on his door and watch him shit himself as i repossess my machine. But my wife being the voice of reason calmed me down and said to try legal avenues first.

coincidentally he emails me 3 days later and says the computer in the machine stopped working. I replied ""which fucking planet do you live on where you steal an item then complain it doesn't work?"" he lol'ed me and said he had an IT guy.

A few days after that i get a call from a guy saying that his friend bought an item and the Hard drive is dead. It was his IT guy, and i don't think he knew the whole story. I asked him to find the serial number, it's just the date it was built and the iteration, for example 2312201901. He read the number out and i said ""oh it's in warranty, send it back and I'll send a fresh new one"" he bought it and sent it back.

Now note that he said the HDD was dead, that's a good thing. If it had been the computer, he could just use anything else and use the HDD as a back up. But since it was dead, and now i had his computer too, he has to buy a new system which would set him back at least $450 but he still couldn't play games in it. You can download the apps but there's a tonne of config work and button mapping etc. 

IT guy calls me a few days later asking for the computer, and I told him the story and that nope, he can go fuck himself. He also lol'ed and asked how hard it could possibly be to just download shit. 

See, what he didn't know is that i have a little fail safe built in. The encoder I use isnt mapped to the default keys on the apps. I changed everything around on the hardware to stop people trying to just clone it. It's not hard to get around, but most people aren't familiar with the nuances of emulators.

inevitably, i get another call a few days later from a different guy saying that he'd built his own machine but couldn't get it working. the symptoms were exactly that of trying to get my controls working on a different system. It was definitely the IT guy fishing. I played dumb and said i didn't know, sorry. Now this guy had an empty useless cabinet, so he left me a one star review on Google.

It's since been removed but it read something like ""poor quality build, flimsy, system doesn't work, do not buy from these people!""

I was about to jump into my truck again and drive down to that fuckface. But again, my wife is like a bucket of ice water to my fire. So i wrote a long letter to Paypal attaching all of my evidence of his fraud. Then i responded to the 1 star review with attachments to the emails and his admission to committing the fraud. Also i displayed his name and email address to smoke him out.

He immediately called and said, ""look, no hard feelings ok, but i received a damaged item and i'm entitled to compensation. Remove my details"" He was getting spammed relentlessly, but he seriously believed he did nothing wrong, I told him to go fuck himself and to enjoy his useless machine. I was still burning though.

I forgot about it after a few weeks, Paypal didn't respond so i cut my losses and moved on. But then something beautiful happened. It's as though the universe aligned and said ""Hey Abs, we're not going to shit on you today, here, take this gift on a silver platter""

I was on ebay looking for old non working machines i can buy and refurb, there's good money to be made doing that. A one day refurb could pull in over $1000 profit. He's listed my machine! but contrary to his google review, the description was ""marvelous hand built arcade cabinet, built by a master carpenter, flawless finish and quality, missing computer. Good for a DIY project"" (I'm not a carpenter by the way) he had it listed for $1100. That was still $1100 pure profit to him since he got it free.

I bought it under my wife's account and had it delivered to my home address. When i sent it, it was wrapped in about a 4 inch thick layer of bubble wrap. When it arrived it had a flimsy single layer less than 5mm thick. The courier who dropped it off was the same guy who picked up from me, we were good friends and he knew the story. So i said i was going to damage it, make it look serious, but nothing i cant fix in a few minutes. He agreed and said that he'd log the damage as due to insufficient packaging. Insurance won't cover it.

I knocked the panels out from inside so it looked like the machine had been crushed, realistically i only had to reset the screws and it was good as new, But it looked mangled.

Then i sent Melbourne dickhead the pics and complained about the damage. He said it was insured.

I advised him the courier said it was insufficiently packaged and that it's not covered, i want a refund, take this back. I knew he wouldn't take it back, it was totally useless to him.

He said he didn't want it and he'll refund the freight. I said nope. I can't do anything with a damaged machine, if he doesn't do anything, I'm filing a Paypal dispute under ""item not as described"" he wasn't happy, played the victim, played on my sympathy still not realizing who i was. Eventually after offering me partial refunds and getting rejected, he relented and told me to keep it and he'd refund me in full. He must've realized that his greed wasn't worth it and it cost him nothing.

So now i had my machine back and I was happy this was over with, still pissed at this guys audacity, but meh. That's not the end though....it gets better, oh does it get deliciously better.

Someone at Paypal business had finally read my complaint. Since I do a lot of work through Paypal under a business account, there's kind of a concierge service although not really, kind of like a priority service. They actually went through my complaint, verified that his pick up docket was actually a year old and unrelated, and read the transcripts of him intending to keep the machine and get a refund.

They refunded my money in full. Now i had my machine back and $3k of his money and he couldn't do shit because he got caught for fraud. Can't dispute shit if you got caught being dishonest

He called me up losing his shit. I laughed and said sorry mate, it's karma, It's purely up to my good will to refund you, go suck a doorknob.

He pleaded and begged, swore a lot, pleaded more, and I said i'll think about it. Legally he had no leg to stand on. But i have scruples. I donated it all to charity on his behalf. I sent him the receipt, he lost his shit some more, but now there were kids with food and clothes because of his douchebag-ness.

The cast:

Salty: Ya boi, sick as a dog, miserable and just wanting bed

SaltBae: The bae of salt, notoriously scent-sensitive

Karen: Self explanatory

It's early morning, maybe around 8:30 AM, and my gf and I are on the bus for uni. As mentioned, I'm sick as all hell, coughing, wheezing, the whole 9 yards. As we get on at a popular hub, we have someone sit in front of us, Karen. Karen had a professional look going on, clearly was someone important somewhere, and the moment she sat down she whipped out her makeup bag and was off   to the races.

As an aside, I don't get why anyone does ANYTHING hygiene or beauty related on public transit. The buses are jerkier than an epileptic at a rave, you get no privacy, and deep down you know every other person on the bus is halfheartedly watching you and judging your taste in lipstick tone. 

But I digress, Karen is working away diligently, until she pulls out a bottle of perfume to finish it up. Well shit. Saltbae is scent-sensitive, the last thing she needs is a dose of perfume administered less than 30 cm away right before her day starts. For Christs sake she's already putting up with Salty, let the poor woman at least have a peaceful bus ride.

So I gently tap on her shoulder, and politely request she not do that in such a confined space, especially near someone who's scent sensitive. She gives me a disgusted look, shakes her head, and goes ""not my problem"" and then hits that perfume button harder than Jong Un hit the nuclear buttons. Great. And wouldn't you know it, that famously jerky movement of the bus took that exact moment to hit the brakes, meaning she leaned forward, and the perfume missed entirely. Where did it go once it missed Karen's vapid crepe paper neck? Yeah. You guessed it. Right into SaltBae's face.

Well I'm mad now. That's for certain. Saltbae is now frantically rubbing her face with her shirt to get it off, and i know a long visit to the washroom to wash it out is warranted for her. Fortunately, none had gotten in her eyes, praise be to the glasses god.

All of a sudden, i can feel it. You know when you're sick and you feel ""it"". ""The big one"". The one that gets you scrambling for a tissue like your life depende on it, the one that makes you politely leave a room so as to not offend any women and children? Yeah. That. A hell of a sneeze. And the evil idea immediately takes form. This ain't going into a tissue my dear reader, no no. Karen had offended SaltBae. And that is unforgivable.

So, with all the aiming precision of Robin Hood at a corrupt nobleman, I sneezed, right into Karen's hair. Please skip the rest of this paragraph if you're squeamish, because godamn, it was gloriously gross. Like soupy green tar, with spittle mixed in, flecks of tiny bits of egg from my breakfast sandwich, hunks of booger, it was the greatest disgusting pile of phlegm to ever let fly, and it sprayed the entire back of Karen's head, in her hair.

Well Karen immediately flips out, and you can see the panic in her eyes and she wheels around and begins yelling at me, while the cogs grind in her puny mind. Does she try to brush it out? Does she let it continue to ferment and settle in? What in the hell to do? Makeup wipes? For a professional businesswoman like her, I imagine she's used to getting her way, not being bested by a man who looks like he requires a coroner more than a doctor at this point.

Either way, I took that opportunity to sweetly smile and say ""Not my problem."" God, her face was like a cherry tomato, so red I was legit worried she'd blow a gasket.

Luckily for me, my uni stop was right ahead, so shortly after SaltBae and I departed, leaving Karen with an oozing disaster in her hair, and a story in my repetoire for that time I became a bioweapon. 

Have a nice day Karen, glad your makeup is on fleek.

My names Brucie, well my fake name is, I prefer it over OP sometimes.. I'm from r/entitledparents with a story I experienced myself a few hours ago. Someone told me to post it here so here you go! Tldr at the bottom! 

So it's exam season and I'm in the ""extra care"" group. This group requires a bit of a boostie during an exam, and for me I require a laptop and a lone space. I have a few psychological issues and my hands are incredibly shakey constantly, so i use a laptop for all of my exams rather than hand writing it. I have been since Y9 and I'm currently in Y13.

One major issue with me is I can't think straight unless I talk out loud. I can do this in a hushed whisper, but it's why I have to be alone. I'm seated at the back of a large hall with my computer, far away from everyone else, so I can freely explain my thoughts to myself while tapping away.

Before I get on with the story I should explain Mr M. Mr M is a high end teacher with two students in this school, neither are important for this story. Mr M prioritises those students heavily and puts them in the best classes whenever he could, the classes I was in. They always got the top marks and were always winners in some sort of contest. I, being the quiet minded kid who focused much more on daydreaming about hulk fantasies, didn't care too much about these brats. I just kept on keeping on. Well until today.

I was in my history exam, quietly tapping away about stalinism and how Alexander II fucked everything up by trying to make it more modern. I was also whispering to myself as I did it, telling myself what to write it as I typed, but I felt something. A very sharp tap. I looked up to see Mr M glaring at me sharply. I didn't understand what I did wrong so went back to silently tapping, struggling much more as I'm still very anxious about my thinking issue.

Another hard tap. I turn back to him and he hisses some sort of noncense about me cheating. I remained silent. I would never cheat in an exam, even if I was struggling so bad. Why would he accuse me of it now? The silence persisted until he muttered something about ""having special treatment"" and ""his son requiring the laptop"". And before I could respond he had picked it up and begun walking away.

Now all of this was done in a very quick and quiet movement. I couldn't react, I just sat in stunned silence. My work was gone. I had been in this exam for an hour. I wanted to break down and cry, this was all too much for me. It was lucky Mrs D, the one who was in charge of the exams, quickly noticed my lack of computer.

Mrs D was the one who gave me the computer in the first place, so knew something was up. She told me to go with her as she took me outside, where I explained everything. The lack of computer, Mr M accusing me of cheating, being kicked out of the exam hall, EVERYTHING. She listened contently then told me to stay there and went off somewhere.

From what I got told from a teacher who heard the commotion, being near Mr Ms classroom, Mrs D had tore him a new one. She berated him for ruining my exam and stealing my property without any knowledge of my conditions. She eventually returned to me with the laptop and my memory drive, luckily he hadn't removed it, and gave me an extra time slip for 15 minutes. Luckily I was able to get that exam completed, even though it left me a bit shaken up.

This situation allowed other situations where students had failed or had work stolen due to this teacher, and it got to a point where they couldn't keep him on. So they fired him. And his kids? They got expelled. His licence was also removed for our country and will probably be the same for the rest.

If this doesn't fit here please tell me, I had it recommended that's all.

I said sorry let me make it up to you next week. But really I was planning my prank. You see, my Girlfriend has a fear of [tiny holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia)so I decided to make my apology themes around it.

I started because our family was struggling for money and I had saved just enough to start up a shop in our town shopping centre. It grew a bit and we ventured to make our first large-ish market thing near where I live.  

Op - me

Ei - entitled idiot

G - guard/security

Po - police officer 


For a celebration of our third store opening I (owner) decided to throw a party at a nearby pub. It had an ok selection of drinks ranging from about £5 to £50 . I set a limit for the total cost of drinks to be £75  and any more drinks you would have to pay for (important later) 
Enter EI 10 mins late of course.
So after everyone arrives I come around asking what people would like to have when the EI comes up to me and says “ order MINE first,  you are clearly a minimum wage worker so I will fire you if you don’t “ she said it in a quite smug voice. (Also note I am wearing jeans and a T-shirt as I didn’t want to get my whites dirty. Also she is the manager) I just shrug it off and assume she was in a bad mood. When I order the drinks I order the drinks in order of employment (mine, managers manager, manager (EI) guards (G)  and then minimum wage workers.) we don’t have many employees only 12 at the time. I order the managers managers drinks first. When I deliver her drinks she comes up to me and wails about how “You did not order MY drinks first so I’ll just have to order more and make YOU pay for the extra £50 (she already spent just under the limit)” so I said trying not to become unprofessional “ ok just call the owner to check if it’s ok”  she called the police saying “ I’ve got this skinny white boy threatening me “ then she called the owner(me)  blaring into the phone saying” I want to charge my minimum workers, especially this one who is harassing me” she blared that into the phone before looking at me the look on her face was priceless. I called the guard to keep her in place whilst I talked to the PO who had now arrived ( it’s a small town)  I said “ look on the cctv and you will see ( I began to smile broadly) . Apparently she was under warrant for arrest and had to pay a hefty £230,000 pound fine plus the £50 for the drink for multiple things. She did not have that money because although she was earning shy over 150k a year she spent it on useless things (expensive makeup, expensive clothes, expensive perfume those things) . I walked passed her and fired her and then she blew up. She elbowed me and said “assault, assault” she did this five times until the guard came and said “op has done nothing wrong so leave the premises now” she got escorted out. Her life crashed. 2 years after the incident I found her begging for money. I kinda felt sorry and hired her in minimum wage with close supervision of the same guard.

A huge part of my responsibilities was to ensure that enough funding could be allocated to both clubs and external organizations throughout the year.

An organization had approached us requesting $6,000 for a ""Black Student Only"" graduation event... now my personal thoughts on this event aside, at our exec meeting I told her flat out that 1. The $6,000 was far above the $3,000 donation limit within our bylaws, and 2. We could not afford to donate that much, given the budget cuts we were facing from the college. Our executive team voted against this motion and it was defeated... until she brought it to our monthly board meeting.

Here in front of two school newspapers, she (the official spokesperson of the union) accused me and a colleague of being racist for citing our concerns against funding this event, ultimately bullying the board into passing this motion, and illegally providing funding for this event. (This is not the first time she'd pulled shit like this, constantly using the privilege card to get her way in meetings, and accusing us as ""colonizers on this land"" of not understanding the ""other viewpoints"" of the victims out there.)

This was ridiculous as  1. Both of us were brown dudes, who are most definitely NOT racist, and 2. Because of her actions, we would not be able to afford to fund a range of events such as our outdoor art festival, clubs week, etc.  

So I hatched my revenge. She had a low understanding of the bylaws and would constantly misquote them to suit her needs, so I took advantage of this to start the impeach process against her. With 15% of the students signing a petition for a referendum, we could trigger a vote to impeach her and get her out.  With a team of 20 students who all had a disdain for her, we got those signatures in a week.

Furthermore, as the signing officer for the union, I had the authority to contact our lawyers and communicate with them about questions or concerns I had with financing/bylaws... to which I asked if what she did was legally allowed? The answer I got in writing was no, that is considered slander, could pursue punitive damages for that if I chose. 

It's now a week after she pulled her bullshit racecard, and I had the happiest moment of my career in that union. I handed her the petition with 2500 signatures and told her that I was triggering a referendum against her to impeach her as ""you are not fit to be a leader. You lie, you take advantage of people in the office, and contribute nothing"".

Her face was a mix of rage and confusion - kinda unsure of how I did this since she thought I was this dumb little boy who was going to let her walk all over me. WRONG.  I let her know that per our bylaws the referendum was to happen within 14 days so she may resign before then or we will do this with the whole school watching. I was about to give her the letter too when she started to yell at me telling me ""YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT"" , ""I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR BREAKING YOUR OWN BYLAWS"", etc. - I just noped tf outta there. If she wants to do this public, so be it.

I was anxious as shit for the next two weeks (did not want to work in my office with her), but come the day of the referendum I was a buzz with excitement... the format was an emergency general meeting where cases were pleaded and a vote took place with members raising their hands to cast yes or no.

The auditorium we chose was PACKED. 800 kids in the room, many carrying a proxy card to vote on behalf of up to 10 students.

She pled her case stating that as a woman, she was being unfairly targeted as a leader who was only ""standing up for marginalized communities"" and that us VP's were doing this because we didn't like her as a person (which to be fair at this point WE DID NOT, but that's unrelated).

I went up to the mic and started to spill all of the bylaws she's purposefully broken, and just poured out how toxic she'd made working in the office in my tenure. I had a signed affidavit from 10 members of our board confirming she abused her position as the official spokesperson of the union to slander my co-worker and me then pulled out the letter from the lawyer and put it onto a document magnifier to show the room that what she did was against the law and could result in punitive damages against the UNION. 

I told the students ""you know what type of leader she is, and you know what type of harm she'll bring if she continues in this role. I do not want to sue this union, because I care about the well being of you students, and cannot in good conscience bankrupt you all. Please vote knowing this and who really cares about the students.  Thank you"".

And like that, we motioned to a vote. With proxies, we had 1000 for impeachment and 200 against (mostly from her friend group). She finally fucking got rid of that smug look on her face and genuinely started to realize that people were NOT ON HER SIDE. I just smiled as the meeting came to adjourn and watched her leave.

The rest of the term was uneventful with a by-election taking place in the spring and a new President being appointed for 2 months before we were done. The best feeling was seeing her around campus, and her just me looks of loathing.  Shoulda known yer bylaws beach.

Also, he was arrested in 2015 but I wanted to share the story.

My entire school career sucked. For a multitude of reasons but one of them was when I was a Freshman in high school I had a bully who was a fucking psycho. 

His name was Justin. 

When I was a freshman I was dating a Junior, so for whatever insecure high school reasons already most Junior guys didn’t like me. Justin was a Junior. So by this time he already had a well known reputation of being a physically violent psychopath. God knows how he stayed in school that long. There were stories of Justin doing this, hurting that person, saying this crazy thing etc. Shit like he said he wanted to join the army after school just so he could kill people legally. Honestly, he had all the makings of a school shooter that I’m un-sarcastically and truly surprised he never shot up the school. I’d like to think that nowadays school’s have a better handle on the warning signs and would take active steps to remove these type of people from the school before another avoidable tragedy happens.

Anyways,

I would see him in the halls and he was this tall guy with this crazy, dark, dead look in his eyes. You would feel super uneasy just seeing him. He was evil and you could feel it.

Where I come into the picture:

We shared the same lunch period. One day we were outside and I was wearing a shirt of a music group that had/has a cult following. At the time I was an avid and unapologetic member of that fan base. He comes up to me and says “Fuck {that band}!” My immediate response without thinking or hesitation was matter of factly “Fuck you.” 

Oh man.  

I believe we got into our first physical altercation then and there but I do remember for certain him following me inside after the period was over threatening and intimidating me. Since that point, I was on his shit list. He would seek me out and then jump me. He would threaten me and punch me. One time he called my house repeatedly (back when we had a landline) and scream and curse and threaten my mother to come and kill her and me. That time my mother actually called the police and an officer came to our home and both me and my mother made statements. As how it usually goes, he already had a criminal record and was already known by police. Nothing really came of it though.

I got so fed up of being physically terrified when being at school that I would actually bring a hatchet with me. At lunch I would take it out of my bag and put it in my pocket. I wanted to hurt him...but only to protect myself. I didn’t care anymore. I'm by nature not a physically violent person to others...but I was at my breaking point. Luckily, I never brandished or used it. After a handful of months of continual torment and abuse I guess he got bored, so he would only fuck with me if he happened to see me. A quarter through my sophomore year I ended up going to an out of state boarding school so that was the end of it. 

Until about 9 years later. 

I stayed in distant contact with the Junior girlfriend I had back when I was a Freshman...and she knew how Justin tormented me. She messages me on Facebook with just a link and says “the world is a safer place now. karma!”

Justin is a certified anti social violent psychopath, and those people don’t change. 

In 2015 at the age of 27 he was hunted and arrested by the US Marshall Fugitive Task Force division. Among the 34, ***I REPEAT 34-COUNT*** indictment, he raped and strangled two ex girlfriend’s, threatened one of the with a sledgehammer, shot and killed her dog in front of her and told her if she ever tells anyone he would do to her what he did to her dog.

**THAT** is my high school bully. I hope he rots in prison, and when he dies, rots in hell...where he belongs. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I just did a quick google search and I couldn't find anything on his sentence, but I have no doubt he's in prison for the rest of his life.

Company A did fencing/walls/barriers etc Company A was ran by Bob. Bob was a real upstanding guy, took over the business from his father and really grew it into something big.

Bob had an employee, Jake. Jake had been with Company A for quite a few years but Bob and Jake always rubbed off on each other in the wrong ways. Bob always felt like Jake was the king of shortcuts and shoddy workmanship.

When Bob took over the company from his dad, Bob applied more pressure on Jake to bring up the quality of his work or be let go. Eventually Jake got tired of the the increased pressure and quit and formed his own fencing company called Company B.

Here is where I come in, I started a job in a company providing business services to small to medium sized businesses in the area and both Company A and Company B became my clients.  This was several years after Company B had formed.

From my outside view point Company A was that local company that's been around forever that does good quality work that you can trust...but they aren't going cheap, they never try to be cheap, but you can trust them. Company B was the young start up who was cutting corners and being competitive in every way possible, often by lying, or misleading its customer.

Thats when company C comes in, Company C was a building a production facility in the area and wanted a wall with gates around its new production facility. This was going be a BIG contract and really the only two players in the area that could possibly do this job was Company A or company B. This contract was worth alot, if my memory serves me correctly the job was somewhere near 7 figures. 

Company A and Company B went to go bid. Company B came in at like a 30% lower price point and even though Bob tried to explain it wasn't possible for Company B to do the work that was promised at the price point that was given. Of course money talks and Company B got the contract. 

I remember Bob was furious, in his eyes he felt what Jake was doing was wrong, he didn't mind fair competition but Jakes MO has always been way underbid, over promise, rely on cost overuns to make a profit. Bobs opinion on business was a price is a price and if he says he's going X for Y he's going do X for Y even if he losses money. Its how he was raised.  

Some time goes by, and Bob gets a call from company C, they've apparently fired Jake and his company due to not being able to do the work required and ask Bob if he can come in and fix the mistakes. Bob agrees, and gets the job done. At this point Bob starts thinking, he's gotta take Jake out. Jake is taking too much money out of his pocket. 

Bob comes up with the idea of buying Jake out. But Bob knows if he approaches Jake regardless of what he offers to pay Jake is going say no. So Bob has got to be smart. Bob is talking to me about this doing one our meetings, we had become quite close. And I tell Bob ""I bet there are lawyers out there who specialize in helping other companies acquire other companies. Bob asks me if I know of any...I don't but I did have a client who specialized in business law who would be more familiar with this whole thing. I give Bob his contact info and Bob thanks me.

Bob contacts the lawyer and tells the lawyer what he would like to do. The lawyer tells Bob a lawyer who used to work for him now works for a firm that speacilizes in mergers and acquisitions and if Bob wanted to buy out Jakes company he's confident this firm could get it done. Also this firm was in the big city far away from their small community so its  unlikely Jake would know what's truly going on.

Bob contacts the firm and says he wants to buy out his competitor and would like to enlist their services. Now this is already getting a bit longer so I'll get to the point. This firm ended up buying Jakes company, lock, stock, and barrel and gave the company to Bob. All the while Jake was completely oblivious to the fact that his arch enemy has just acquired his very own company.

I recall Bob describing to me the day he walked into Jakes company with such delight. Bob was told he owned the company, Jake had been paid and was expecting to meet the new owner of the company that pleasant Monday morning. Jake was given the title of General Manager. And was considered 2nd in command now. 

So Bob walked into the building that once belonged to Jake with his documents and the lawyer that had helped him acquire the firm (Who Jake was familiar with) Bob walked into Jakes office to Jakes surprise

Jake: Hi Bob

Bob: Hi Jake, how are you?

Jake: I'm good, what are you doing here?

Bob: O nothing much, just thought I'd come check out my newly acquired business

Jake: Uh?

Bob: Jake, you sold your copmany to me

Jake: I did what? No I didn't! I sold it to XYZ

Bob: XYZ is the law firm I hired to organize the transaction I am now the owner.

Jake: That's bullshit

Bob: Here's the documents, (lawyer who Jake was familiar with confirmed this was all true)

Jake: So your now my boss?

Bob: yes, now get up, that's my chair and I'm tired I wanna sit down for a minute

Jake: This is my office

Bob: This is my company, and I have decided that this office is now my office so I'm going need you to get out of my chair

Jake gets out of chair

Bob: Great, well have a sit Jake

Jake: Thanks

Bob: Jake I think the first order of business today is getting rid of redundancies 

Jake: What do you mean?

Bob: Well you see Jake whenever a company acquires another company you get overlap, redundancies. Two HR departments, two sectaries, two accountants, etc. But now its all one company, so now you got redundancies, overlaps, which is quite frankly a waste of money.

Jake: Yea...

Bob: And I don't need two owners working for one company, (and he laughs and tells me he had the biggest shit eating grin on his face) Jake, its become apparent that your services are no longer required and effective immediately you are terminated.  

Jake: Protested

Bob: The decision is final, you may collect your personal belongings and leave the premises, what time did you get to work this morning?

Jake: 7 AM

Bob: Great, so you've been here for 2 hours, I'll make sure payroll pays you out for 2 hours on the agreed upon rate in the buy out agreement, have a nice day.

Jake: So your just firing me? Just like that?

Bob: Yup, should have done this long ago

Jake: what about my family?

Bob: Jake, I just bought your company from you and paid you a lot of money, you'll be fine. Now get out of my office and out of my building.

So my grandfather and his friend find the biggest and heaviest rock they can find and build a sand castle over it covering it in sand.

They then wait in a bush while watching the bully, the bully comes along the beach and sees the “sand castle” he then goes up to it raises his foot and kicks it, immediately a loud scream and the bully yells in pain while hopping around and holding his foot while my grandfather and his friend watched while trying not to laugh while hiding in a bush.

I contact the seller and ask to buy it with tracked shipping. I pay for it up front because generally honor is a pretty big thing in Norway and stealing is very frowned upon, people usually follow up on the sending with no issue (although I’m not doing that again lol). 

Now If I ask for tracked shipping and pay for it, and the sender or the post office doesn’t have a receipt/documentation for sending it, it is their legal obligation to send back the money if it doesn’t arrive. 

So I try to contact him and he says it’s just a bit delayed. A few more weeks go by and nothing, and he stops answering my messages. I tell him about the legal stuff and he continues to ignore me. 

A week later I message his parents and gf on Facebook with screenshots of both the conversation and the transaction. He then messages me and says he’ll send me the money when he gets paid in 2 weeks. 

2 weeks go by and surprise, no payment and no response to my messages. I then contact about 10 people from his Instagram with the story and screenshots and saying he’s not responding to me.  Im not bothered to go through the police cause that would take forever. Im relying on the honor culture that he’ll be socially pressured into returning the money. He says he needs another 2 weeks to pay me back. I check his Facebook again and see that he just bought a brand new mountain bike for around $1000 which infuriated me. 

A woman responds saying she’d ask him about it via text. He says to her that he never got the money, so I sent a screen cap of the transaction and him saying he received the money and sent the package, so her and I caught him in a lie.

He then responds to my originally texts saying that he was gonna pay me back, but now that I have told people about it, he doesn’t want to. And he says it’s illegal for me to message his friends and takes the moral high road after scamming me for $600(fuck this guy! Right?), I read up on the laws and this kind of social pressuring isn’t illegal or punishable here.

He stops responding to me again, so now I message 30 people via his Facebook and Instagram to his family and friends. I get a lot of responses and a lot of people taking my side of this. He must’ve gotten bombarded with questions and messages, as he messages me an hour later saying he’ll pay me back, just get the messages to stop. 2 days later I finally get my money back a few months after the scam.

step MIL I will use D, and for my partner SO. TL;DR at the bottom.

A little back story. SO's dad has a thing for emotionally and sometimes physically abusive women (with the exception of SO's biological mom). SO's dad brought home D when SO was around 15yrs old. D could never hold down a job. Whenever she did get one, it wouldn't be long before it came to an end and it was always someone else's fault. She never finished university, again not her fault. 

She has also confided in me, my SO and his dad some off the wall stories that don't make any sense but she swears they happened. For example, she apparently dated a Guatemalan prince who convinced her to fly back to Guatemala where he kidnapped her and beat her as well as convinced all the airports to not let her fly back home to Canada.
She was often verbally abusive to my SO growing up, she would scream at him for no reasons such as ""petting the dog too hard."" I have many other examples of her craziness but I'll leave it at that.

Here is where it all started for me. It was 2017 and I was 19 at the time and I had driven to SO dad's house, SO was still living there at the time. We decided to leave to go back to my place. Side note, they live in the country and have a huge drive way. D always parked in the same spot and so did I when I visited. I was in the habit of not having anyone behind me when I put my car into reverse and took my foot off the break to roll out. I didn't noticed D's car behind me and I bumped into it. She was parked a meter *directly* (remember this) behind me.

D at the time was sitting inside the house watching TV, all windows and doors closed (it was May in Canada), when we left but she ran outside IMMEDIATELY after bumping her car. I barely got out of the car when she ran out. I apologize and when I checked my car there was absolutely no damage, I have a plastic bumper. Her car appeared to have the LEFT SIDE of the hood and frame dented inwards. This damage to her car was a lot more than I was expecting considering how lightly I bumped her car. so my first thought is to call my dad (I was living with my parents at the time.) I told her I was going to do so and she said not to worry about it and not tell my parents because they would never let me drive again. I knew my parents wouldn't be like that but I didn't want them to be frustrated with me and since my car was fine I thought it cant be that bad so I decided to put my phone away. She also said that she didn't want to call the police because she didn't want to have to deal with them. I felt awful at the time but also really confused, I started to have that gut feeling that something was wrong. Another side note, I'm a really quiet person who has anxiety so I can have a habit of letting people take advantage of that. 

She said, ""I'll just replace the hood, it will only cost 500$"" I should mention she was driving an old car that was 19 years old. I thought at the time that that sounds reasonable so I agreed. I'm a student at uni so I could only afford to give her 200$ up front and a few months down the road I gave her the other 300. 

In December SO and I decide to get our passports to potentially go on a trip together. I was visiting my SO D approaches and said ""You know you can't go around flaunting your passports when you owe people money"". I just stood there not saying a word because I didn't know what to say to that. She continues saying I owed her 700$ more. I told her that I dont understand, Its been months and that I thought I had already gave her what she had wanted.  My SO then rolls his eyes and walks away at that point. She the  starts ranting on about how awful it is to live with my SO and that I could do so much better. She actually said ""There's no such thing as a magic penis, you're just going to get tired of him. You have a lot of potential, you could do better.""  I was so shocked, I don't remember what I said but I remember I came up with an excuse to leave.

This is when I turn to my parents like I should have in the first place. My Dad says not to worry and that he will drive over to talk it out with them. My Dad comes home after an hour or so saying he had a beer with them and they decided that they will take their car to the garage to get an estimate and then my dad will take the car to his garage for an estimate. My dad is a stationary engineer and also knows everything about cars and had offered to fix it for free. They had agreed to show my dad the estimates within a week and also to not bother me about it anymore since I was trying to focus on school and this was giving me bad anxiety. They also said they were planning on scrapping the car and that I would only need to pay if they get the repairs done. I felt so annoyed that he even agreed to that since it's been several months since the incident but turns out this was part of a plan of his.

D eventually gets rid of her own car and SOs dad buys her jobless bum a new one. We find out it cost 2000$ She's been driving the old car up until this point.

Months go by, it is now June and my dad is sitting at home when the phone rings, it's SO's dad. He asked my dad for 2800$... not only has it been months since they last spoke, and a year since the incident, we also have never saw an estimate on paper. My dad laughs and just says no. D starts screaming, full on screaming. SO and I were sitting in the basement at his house so we could hear everything. She screams ""I TOLD YOU!!! I TOLD YOU!!!"" And more screams we dont understand and ""TAKE AWAY HER LICENSE!!"" The screaming lasts for around 5-10min. My Dad invites SO's Dad over for a beer so they could have an actual conversation about it with screaming but SO's dad declined.

That month there's a letter sitting on the table for me when I get home that my brother had picked up for me. It was from a paralegal, saying I had owed them 2800$ but, she was only going to ask for 1500$ since I already paid 500$. This letter not only had spelling mistakes but mathematical errors. We get a lawyer friend to send them a letter and we thought that was that. 

SO eventually moves in with me and my parents, because the emotional abuse from D became worse and was too much for him. She actually wouldnt let SO eat the food that SO's dad paid for. She would leave notes on everything saying ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH,"" and D and SO's dad would even have family dinner with his brother and grandma and not let him join while he was still living there. SOs dad ""tried"" to have him be allowed at the dinner table but D had SOs dad wrapped around her finger and could get him to do whatever she wants. The sad thing is that SO's dad was basically pleading for us to stay and cook and hangout but he didn't have the nerve to face his partner to ask her to stop. He would just say that D is just like that sometimes and ""I just really want everyone to get along and for us to be a family"" This is in August.

A year goes by, it is August again. I've moved out of town with SO. I get a message on Facebook from a different paralegal saying I've been served, asking for the same amount. I didn't even think that was legal in Canada but somehow this was court approved. The letter claims I ran OVER TOP the hood of her car with mine and that I agreed to pay for everything. Attached to this was an estimate from a mechanic, this was the first time I've seen any paperwork in 2 years! Not only that, the estimate was dated a year after the incident. There was a ton of mechanical damage that my dad says there's no way I would have been able to do that without damaging my car. My dad also points out, how did I damage the side of the car when she was parked directly behind me? I didn't even think of that. 

My Dad decides to represent me and he responds counter suing for the 500 I gave them since they had agreed that the money would be going to repair the car (he just did that to piss them off) and saying yes I hit the car but not to to the extent she's describing. Then we claimed what I had written above in a shorter way. My dad has lawyer friends look over our case and they laughed and said that my dad did a really good job writing everything up and that this case is so ridiculous we should be fine.

We go to our court settlement meeting and the first thing D accused me of was impaired driving. When it was my turn to speak my dad and I call her out on that right away and she says ""well, you said you were tired."" She also accused my dad coming over and being aggressive with them, referring to the time they had a beer together and that I'm the reason why they have a crappy relationship and so on. She said that I crashed into her car and it was in horrible condition and wasn't safe to drive. The judge calls her out on this saying that she drove it for months and that she drove it to a different city to go to the garage so it couldn't have been that bad. She also said that I went to Cuba, referring to the time my SO and I got our passport, saying thats why she is here today because if we can go to Cuba then we can afford to give them more money lol. We didn't even go to Cuba, not that this is relevant to the case. 
As she continues her voice gets louder and louder to the point that she's screeching at the judge. The judge says that she's beating a dead horse and that he feels like he's watching an episode of family feud. He told her the only way she would get anywhere is if she somehow could get the value of the car before I hit it. As you could guess we didn't settle on anything. 

A couple weeks later we get a letter for an offer to settle and we deny. 

My dad goes full investigation mode and finds the exact model of her car that was in top condition and its value is only 700$ he takes photos with a measuring tape showing that the damage doesn't even line up with my car. And we found that in the photos of her car that she took, there's rust around the damage so clearly she had already damaged the car way before hand. My dad also asked for her insurance info on the car because we had a feeling that she might be committing insurance fraud and they refused giving us anything saying she never contacted the insurance so there's nothing to show. 

Her paralegals continue to try to settle for an offer multiple times but we deny.

February 2019, the big day has arrived and we go to court. It didn't seem to start off so well because D had 2 paralegals and the judge told me my dad wasn't allowed to represent me because he didn't bring enough documentation. So with no notice, I had to represent myself. But the Judge did allow me to talk to my dad and ask him questions. D starts off saying that I was ""Tired impaired"" and that I had agreed to pay the 2000$ at least from the start. She said she didn't need to show me a written estimate because she could tell just by looking at it and I should have just taken her word and given her the money. She said the only reason why she got the estimate a year later was because we were ""demanding to see one."" (Sure D! Let me just give you 3000$ just because you asked) she said that I'm a grown women and could have called the cops if I wanted to, and that she ""needed to teach me a lesson that will hurt."" She then brings up that we went Cuba and spent about 4000$ on that trip and she deserved that money and that we should have given it to her instead.

Throughout the process the judge was being really kind towards me, giving me smiles of encouragement and even gave some small pointers of when I should say what. I just want to give her a shout out for being so supportive.

The whole time I'm interrogating D with my questions, she answers every question raising her voice pointing fingers at me, rolling her eyes and just genuinely being rude, just as I hoped for.

So let's here what the judge had to say. She says that D was ""being opportunistic, taking advantage of a new driver"" and that D ""is a grown women too who is also capable of making her own decisions and could have called the cops,"" She said that this should have never gone to court. The whole time D was sighing and throwing her hands up in the air. Then the Judge says, ""its easy for me to tell just by the attitude in this room today that you were bullying a 19 year old new driver into giving you money."" She also said it was ridiculous that D wanted to ""teach me a lesson"" 

D was the first to leave the room and as we exited... the look on D's face!! It looked like she was trying to kill us with her eyes. We all walk out with huge grins on our faces and as we walk by her we couldn't help but make loud jokes about taking a celebratory trip to Cuba. I swear she was about to say or do something to us the way she was staring at us, it looked like she wasn't even blinking, just a cold death glare but then both her paralegals got her attention and guided her away from us.

We celebrated with a lobster dinner that night.

Thanks Dad

Back in college, I served in the student union as their Vice-President of Finance. A huge part of my responsibilities was to ensure that enough funding could be allocated to both clubs and external organizations throughout the year.

An organization had approached us requesting $6,000 for a ""Black Student Only"" graduation event... now my personal thoughts on this event aside, at our exec meeting I told her flat out that 1. The $6,000 was far above the $3,000 donation limit within our bylaws, and 2. We could not afford to donate that much, given the budget cuts we were facing from the college. Our executive team voted against this motion and it was defeated... until she brought it to our monthly board meeting.

Here in front of two school newspapers, she (the president and official spokesperson of the union) accused me and a colleague of being racist for citing our concerns against funding this event, ultimately bullying the board into passing this motion, and illegally providing funding for this event. (This is not the first time she'd pulled shit like this, constantly using the privilege card to get her way in meetings, and accusing us as ""colonizers on this land"" of not understanding the ""other viewpoints"" of the victims out there.)

This was ridiculous as  1. Both of us were brown dudes, who are most definitely NOT racist, and 2. Because of her actions, we would not be able to afford to fund a range of events such as our outdoor art festival, clubs week, etc.  

So I hatched my revenge. She had a low understanding of the bylaws and would constantly misquote them to suit her needs, so I took advantage of this to start the impeach process against her. With 15% of the students signing a petition for a referendum, we could trigger a vote to impeach her and get her out.  With a team of 20 students who all had a disdain for her, we got those signatures in a week.

Furthermore, as the signing officer for the union, I had the authority to contact our lawyers and communicate with them about questions or concerns I had with financing/bylaws... to which I asked if what she did was legally allowed? The answer I got in writing was no, that is considered slander, could pursue punitive damages for that if I chose. 

It's now a week after she pulled her bullshit racecard, and I had the happiest moment of my career in that union. I handed her the petition with 2500 signatures and told her that I was triggering a referendum against her to impeach her as ""you are not fit to be a leader. You lie, you take advantage of people in the office, and contribute nothing"".

Her face was a mix of rage and confusion - kinda unsure of how I did this since she thought I was this dumb little boy who was going to let her walk all over me. WRONG.  I let her know that per our bylaws the referendum was to happen within 14 days so she may resign before then or we will do this with the whole school watching. I was about to give her the letter too when she started to yell at me telling me ""YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT"" , ""I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED FOR BREAKING YOUR OWN BYLAWS"", etc. - I just noped tf outta there. If she wants to do this public, so be it.

I was anxious as shit for the next two weeks (did not want to work in my office with her), but come the day of the referendum I was a buzz with excitement... the format was an emergency general meeting where cases were pleaded and a vote took place with members raising their hands to cast yes or no.

The auditorium we chose was PACKED. 800 kids in the room, many carrying a proxy card to vote on behalf of up to 10 students.

She pled her case stating that as a woman, she was being unfairly targeted as a leader who was only ""standing up for marginalized communities"" and that us VP's were doing this because we didn't like her as a person (which to be fair at this point WE DID NOT, but that's unrelated).

I went up to the mic and started to spill all of the bylaws she's purposefully broken, and just poured out how toxic she'd made working in the office in my tenure. I had a signed affidavit from 10 members of our board confirming she abused her position as the official spokesperson of the union to slander my co-worker and me then pulled out the letter from the lawyer and put it onto a document magnifier to show the room that what she did was against the law and could result in punitive damages against the UNION. 

I told the students ""you know what type of leader she is, and you know what type of harm she'll bring if she continues in this role. I do not want to sue this union, because I care about the well being of you students, and cannot in good conscience bankrupt you all. Please vote knowing this and who really cares about the students.  Thank you"".

And like that, we motioned to a vote. With proxies, we had 1000 for impeachment and 200 against (mostly from her friend group). She finally fucking got rid of that smug look on her face and genuinely started to realize that people were NOT ON HER SIDE. I just smiled as the meeting came to adjourn and watched her leave.

The rest of the term was uneventful with a by-election taking place in the spring and a new President being appointed for 2 months before we were done. The best feeling was seeing her around campus, and her shooting me looks of loathing.  Shoulda known yer bylaws beach.

For some background, my sister has had issues carrying pregnancies to term after her first child. I don't know the full details why, but basically having her son messed her hormones up so badly that her body stops recognising the fetus as a fetus after a few weeks and dissolves it.

A few years ago, my sister was pregnant again, but this time she made it all the way to five months. All her other pregnancies barely got to 7 weeks, and the doctors hadn't seen any signs that this pregnancy was going wrong so we all got excited. Unfortunately, my sister suffered a miscarriage just after the six month mark because of the heart medication she was on that her doctor had failed to change or warn her would cause issue.

This story isn't about the doctor failing to warn or change the medication, but I know most of you will want to know if anything happened to him and it did. The hospital that helped my sister through the miscarriage (it was a dangerous one and could have killed her) wrote to the national health board and since the baby *would* have been viable if it was born, the doctor was fired and banned from practising medicine in the UK ever again for gross medical misconduct that caused the death of an infant.

Fast forward a couple of months and my sister built a small flower garden as a memorial to her daughter. She tends to this garden every single day, even when she feels like crap, and buried her wrist tag from the day she went to the hospital in it.

Now, my sister lived in a small block of apartments at the time, two stories tall and semi detached. Her upstairs neighbour was the *worst* kind of old man. He had his TV on max volume at all hours of the day, would throw chicken bones out the window into my sister's garden in the hope her dogs would eat them and *choke to death,* berated my nephew for playing in the *public* street, called my sister all kinds of names whenever they crossed paths and made one single death threat that he quickly rescinded when I told him I had a black belt in Aikedo and was fully prepared to break every bone in his body if he even *tried* it.

I am not a small woman, and am pretty muscular from said Aikedo, so he backed off.

Since the guy lived upstairs, his garden wasn't attached to the property like my sister's. It was a fenced off area just *behind* my sister's, and he never used it.

Well one day he was walking down the alleyway that led to his garden when he started ranting about their being cat shit in his garden. My sister also had cats, and they regularly went outside during the day. However, we lived in pretty built up area so there was literally *hundreds* of other homes with cats who could have shit in his garden. He decided it was *absolutely* my sister's cats though, and started to berate her through the gate. It was only about three feet high.

My sister is *not* somebody who backs down easy, often to her own detriment, so she argued back that he had no proof and that her cats hadn't even been *out* that day. When the neighbour continued to yell and insult, she told him that she was sick of his behaviour and that she was going to make *another* report to the housing association.

We'd made numerous ones, but in the UK getting somebody evicted is a lot harder than it rightly should be in these cases. We had *photographic evidence* of what he had been doing, but it hadn't been enough to get his kicked out, just slapped with warnings.

Well, once the neighbour realised he couldn't bully my sister, who is more petite than me, into just agreeing with him he decided to 'punish' her. My niece's garden was in a hanging basket on the gate to prevent any of the cats or dogs from digging it up, so the neighbour reached down and ripped all the plants out.

My sister was *horrified,* and just froze up. I was in the house, so I didn't see it go down but when my sister came in, white as a sheet, she told me what happened.

I immediately grabbed my phone, put it on record and walked up to the neighbour's door. Once he answered, I told him I was recording him for my own safety, was is law in the UK, and he said fine. I then told him he had damaged my sister's property and he could either agree to pay for the damages right here on record, or we would be taking him to court. I said this in as calm and polite a manner as I possible could while visibly shaking with rage.

He fucking *headbutted me.*

I don't know if you've ever been headbutted, but it bloody *hurts.* Your vision goes white for a second, and you're completely incapable of processing what just happened because your *brain* was just smashed against your own skull from the force of impact.

When my vision cleared, I saw the neighbour on the floor, knocked out cold. I stopped the recording and played it back to find that he had tried to *strangle* me after he headbutted me, and in my whited-out state I had instinctively punched him at *full strength.*

I posted a story on r/askreddit as little while ago about how I broke a bully's arm by punching it, and with Aikedo training I was stronger than ever. I hadn't hit him in the head, I'm pretty sure I would have *killed* him and I was in no state to aim that well, but I did hit him in the shoulder hard enough for him to bash his head against the door frame, which was what knocked him out.

I called the police, told them what happened and showed the the video of the neighbour attacking me to the officers who arrived on scene. I had a concussion and a nasty bruise, so they took both me and the neighbour to the hospital but the neighbour was cuffed to his bed and I was not.

During my time at the hospital, the police got a statement from my sister about the incident with my niece's garden. My sister wasted *no* time letting the police know of all the complaints and recordings of aggressive behaviour she had saved and sent to the housing association. The hospital kept me in for a week as I was still getting headaches even after the swelling and bruising went down, and by the time I got out not only was the neighbour *evicted* but he was facing prison time as well.

He only got a few months, but considering he was out of work, homeless, his kids (Who had come to pick up his stuff and got chatting with us) all hated him and he was not eligible for any benefits, he probably would have preferred to stay inside.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,921481,public,self,Destroy my Niece's memorial?

What I saw was the turn signal on a newer Audi.  It has a three way turn signal.  It lights up near the center of the car , then the middle of the turn signal and then the edge of the turn signal.  Very cool.  That reminded me of my old schoolmate, we'll call him Dave, because that's his name and Roxanne, aka Foxy Roxy.  

I went to high school with Dave and Roxy.  The year is 1971.  Dave's father owned a garage I think or something to do with cars.  Anyway Dave was kind of an electric tinkering genius.  He had an old car with two circular brake lights on the back.  A Corvair maybe?  At the time a Thunderbird or some other cool car had tail lights that did the center/middle/end turn signal thing.  Dave was handy enough to drill third holes for his brake lights and wire the thing up so it did the same thing.  Impressive as all get out back in 1971.  I knew Dave but not that closely.  Roxy was in one of my science classes.  She had a reputation back then and didn't really care.  During one of the labs she told me - For $15 you can have me for an hour.  I'll do anything you want, anything.  One hour- $15.  I turned her down - probably very awkwardly and never told a soul about it until today.  We didn't hang in the same circles and it was no big deal.  That was 11th grade.  In 12th grade around November rumors started flying around the school.  Dave had knocked up Roxy and both of them had dropped out or been kicked out of school.  Never saw either of them again during high school.  The summer after graduation I ran into Dave at a party.  He was alone.  I asked him how he was doing and he proceeded to tell me that he married Roxy, started working for his Dad and got an apartment.  He wasn't clear on what happened with the kid, miscarriage or died at birth.  Could have been an abortion but that was hush hush back then.  Both his and Roxy's families were Catholic but who knows.  Anyway shortly after Roxy started cheating on him and rubbing his nose in it and they had the marriage annulled.  Dave was angry at what Roxy had done to him.  He told me that he was going to go into business for himself. He was going to build and sell car alarms.  Back in 1972 that was not a very common thing but he knew cars and electronics and thought he could make a go of it.  I figured that he was nuts.  Who the heck needed a car alarm.  He bitched about Roxy cheating on him and how he was going to show her and so on.  Talk is cheap.  

Fast forward about 25 years.  Turns out Dave was way smarter than I gave him credit for.  He started one of the very first car alarm companies and eventually sold his company to some big conglomerate for several million dollars.  He retired in his early 40s - never married again. He came back to visit to our old hometown and looked up some of his buddies, one of which is a friend of mine.  Apparently they were drinking beer and shooting the shit and Dave asks if anyone knows what happened to Roxy.  He still resented her even 25 years later.  Roxy's life didn't go so hot.  She screwed around a lot and actually got arrested once for prostitution.  25 years later she was single, living in a trailer, working as a waitress and about 50 pounds heavier.  She looked far older than her years.  The guys told Dave that Roxy had two daughters shortly after she left Dave.  One had died of an OD a few years back and the other was working as a stripper. That should have been enough revenge for Dave but Roxy must have left some very bad memories.  Dave found out where Roxy's daughter was working and went to the club. Apparently the daughter was in her early 20s and looked a lot like Roxy did back in the day.  She wasn't actually a stripper but a bar girl that flirted with the guys and got them to buy overpriced drinks.  Dave played the ""out of town rich businessman looking for companionship"" card on her and she asked for $1500 for the night (prices had gone up considerably since her mother's day).  Dave negotiated it down to $1000 and they made the deal.  According to my friend Dave was very graphic in telling them how the daughter reminded him a lot of Roxy.  The next morning Dave asked her if he could get a selfie with her to show his friends that even at his age he could get a real hottie and gave her another $100 for a selfie of her french kissing him.  She had a rose tatooed on her wrist and it was apparently very clear in the photo he took. 

By then Dave was probably feeling like his revenge  was complete but he had one more thing on his agenda.  He found the place where Roxy worked and asked the greeter at the restaraunt if he could sit at one of Roxy's tables.  As luck would have it she was working that day.  According to my friend Roxy didn't even recognize Dave, he looked like a middle aged businessman and not a 17 year old hippy after all but Dave knew it was her.  He asked her - don't you remember me?  I sure remember you.  As it began to dawn on her who this guy was she getting a bit nervous.  Dave continues -""I met your daughter last night, she reminds me a lot of you and procedes to pull out his phone with the selfie displayed.  He leaves a $100 bill on the table and walks out, buys drinks for his friends that night and heads back to California never to be seen again as far as I know.

My friend swears this is true but who know, the guys back in my neighborhood did have a way of stretching the truth.  Heck of a story though.....

Story time:

So around 3 years (April 2017 I think), my aunt (Horrible Person) moved in with me. It’s important to know that HP is only 5 months older than me and was adopted by my grandparents when she was just a baby. Back when I lived in the same state as her, my family would often go over to my grandparents house to visit. HP and I basically grew up together and we’re treated like twins...up until around we were 8 years old and everyone quickly found out that we were as different as night and day. Needless to say, we didn’t really get along. 

A couple of years passed since I last saw her when all of this started. My family is military so we ended up moving across the country for 3 years. Towards the end of our last year, I found out that HP was gonna move in with us. My grandparents apparently had enough of her and were actually going to put her in foster care until my mom stepped in and said that we would take her in. My mom is a therapist and diagnosed HP with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and was willing to try and get her some help. 

When I heard the news, I was a little taken back. But my 15 year old innocent mind at the time tried to think that since we haven’t really seen each other since we were around 12, maybe we’ve matured enough to put aside our differences and get along. 

I was very wrong. 

The minute she moved in, my life became a living nightmare. She is in the same grade as me and instantly tried to start drama about me to my friend group and insisted that she needed to know every little detail about what was going on in my personal life because she’s “just trying to protect her little sister”. She would tell everyone EVERYTHING about me which really made me uncomfortable (I have a problem with being vulnerable). Not only that, but she would physically harm herself in front of me if she didn’t get her way. Every day my house was filled with her screaming and throwing tantrums over anything that she dislikes. 

July 2017, we moved to another state. Things only got worse. Being a military brat, I’m used to moving to new schools so fitting in and finding friends wasn’t that hard for me. HP, on the other hand, would rather try to steal my new friends away from me...even though none of them even shared the same classes. If I had a boyfriend, that guy would INSTANTLY become her new best friend. She would try and get close to my friends to find out more information about me only to use that information against me. School life was terrible. I tried everything I could to stay away from her. 

But home life wasn’t any better. I often found myself locked away in my room to try and avoid HP as much as possible. And, like stated before, she was always screaming and crying about anything and everything. She would even barge into my room (without knocking, might I add) at any time, either demanding to know something that’s none of her business or she wanted me to do something for her. She would even physically assaulted me if I told her to fuck off. 

I hated her. I still hate her. This went on for two years and every day I was more and more traumatized, regretting that I ever told my mom that I thought it was okay if she moved in.  

Finally, in the middle of junior year, I had enough. Something happened that made me have a major panic attack and instead of helping me, she instead opted to stand there and watch me cry, laughing and texting her friends about it. When I told my parents what happened, they sat us both down and told me to tell her what she has done to me and how that has effected me. I went on for at least 20 minutes, listing thing after thing and how I’m emotionally traumatized from everything she has put me through. And what was her response? 

“Well...you never tell me anything about yourself so I have to find things out through your friends. So what if you lose a couple on the way? We’re family so that’s all that matters.”

I lost my mind and my parents finally realized that she needed to go as soon as possible. 

“What’s the revenge” you are asking yourself?

It was my choice if she stayed or left. Of course I told her to leave. Oh but it gets worse. My parents told her that she needed to break up with her boyfriend. I don’t exactly remember why but what I do know is that apparently, HP never told her boyfriend that she. Has. HERPES. Lil FYI: that’s technically assault as I know they never used a condom. 

She was gone three days later. My parents took her phone (that they paid for) and sent her on a plane across the country. 

Where is she now? Well now she’s living in her strictly Christian parents junky apartment. She’s turning 19 in June and is MARRIED to a SIXTEEN year old boy. She and her now “husband” dropped out of high school and she contracted chlamydia. She’s been gone for over a year now and me and my family’s life instantly got 100x better. About a month ago she tried to get in contact with me but I just hung up the phone as soon as I heard her voice on the other line. No thank you. 

So in conclusion: Because she treated me and my family like absolute shit and I’m still traumatized from a lot of what she put me through, I put her right back into that shithole where she came from. I’m sure she instantly regretted everything but I couldn’t care less. She got what she deserved.

I used to deliver large cherry pickers to the building trade for a living. One day I was sent to a proving ground (a top secret test track where they test new vehicles away from prying eyes) to pick up a cherry picker that had been out on hire. 

I turn up in my truck late in the afternoon when most contractors have gone home only to find a different contractor using our machine. This happens a lot, contractors can't be bothered to hire their own or use ladders so they just grab any cherry picker they can find and use it. 

I shout up to these 2 guys who were on a ledge/canopy 50ft up the side of this newly built building, that they didn't hire the machine, shouldn't be using it and need to come down. 

They replied that they'll be done in half an hour and I'm going to have to wait. 

I tell them again that they need to come down now or I'll just take the machine wether they are up their or down here. 

One of the guys goes to the basket of the machine, hits the big red E-stop button (disabling the machine) and takes the key out. They both start laughing and mocking me that there's nothing I can do and I'm going to just have to wait for them to finish. 

At this point I'm pissed. If they'd have asked politely for 5 minutes so they could wrap up work I'd have waited but they said 30 minutes and were rude so I decided enough was enough. 

What they didn't know was that on this particular machine, even if you push the E-stop up in the basket, the controls at the base over rode it giving me control down on the ground. 

As soon as I went to the base controls they started laughing again saying that won't work because they hit the E-stop but their laughter stopped as soon as the cherry picker basket started lowering to the ground. 

They started pleading with me that they'd come down now and that they're finished but it was too late. I loaded the cherry picker onto my truck and gave them a big wave as I drove away. 

I rang my boss as I left telling him what had happened as a heads up in case he got an angry call. He sided with me and said he'd have done the same. 

5 mins later my boss calls me back and says one of the guys rang the number on the side of the truck and begged my boss to get me to turn around and come get them down. My boss declined. 

I have no idea how they got down as this was the only cherry picker on the site and nearly everyone had gone home.

We were a part of the same friend group for several years so it only felt natural that we started dating. He had enlisted in the marines and was going overseas in a few months but I was really into him and didn't mind a long distance relationship. Before he left, I took his virginity since he practically begged me to and dumped me a week later. I was extremely torn up about it and told our mutual friends about it. I expressed feeling used and manipulated and they all treated me like shit, saying he was a great guy and that I just wasn't good enough for him. They convinced me that I was the one who needed to apologize, so I did. My ex and I stayed Facebook friends and he was shipped off to Japan.

Not long after, I started dating a different guy who ended up being extremely abusive towards me for over two years. During that time, my ex would message me on Facebook frequently and tell me that he was in love with me and breaking up with me was the worst decision of his life. I rejected him multiple times but we remained friends. I was slowly becoming more depressed and suicidal because of the abuse from my boyfriend at the time. He frequently told me that I was worthless and that if I left him, I would be alone for the rest of my life as no other man would be willing to deal with me. My own mother would even defend his actions if I complained about it to her. After two years of abuse, he dumped me in a very publicly humiliating way, making a huge scene about how I was the worst girlfriend anyone could have and told me to kill myself. I took a bottle of Benadryl and had the most traumatizing experience of my life.

A few days after my suicide attempt, my ex had messaged me on Facebook again and I told him everything that had happened. I was in a terrible state so I was so relieved when I realized he still wanted me. I was afraid that I would be alone for the rest of my life and hated myself severely so, at the time, he was my knight in shining armor. We talked very frequently over the next few months, he told me he loved me every single day. We even talked about our plans for when he got out of the military. He promised that we would get married, have children, and he would fullfill my purpose as a woman by making me a wife and mother. I was raised to believe that all I was good for was to be a sex toy for my husband and a baby factory, so I believed that I wasn't good for anything else.

He came home from Japan for Christmas and he invited me over to his place. I was so happy and excited to see him after so long. He was my happiness. My everything. Without him, I had no other reason to be alive. We had sex. It lasted two minutes and I was left unsatisfied. I had been on birth control for several months because he insisted that he never wanted to wear a condom with me. I didn't feel comfortable with it but we were going to be married so I thought it was okay. I even took a plan B pill as well, just to be safe. He dumped me the next day...just like before.

His friend has told me that he had actually been serious with a Japanese girl for about a year. I confronted him about it and he confirmed it. He told me that he never loved me and that I was nothing but a cum dumpster. He said, I fullfilled my duties and told me to kill myself. He even turned our mutual friends against me, telling them that I was crazy and trying to make up lies about him. I had to delete my social media to escape all the harassment I received. About a month later, his girlfriend somehow got my number and started sending me pictures of the two of them together.

I had lost everything and thought my life was over, so I got a account back and messaged him, telling him I was pregnant and that I needed money for an abortion. He was terrified and believed me immediately without even asking for proof. He sent me around $500 and I took it. I even pretended to have second thoughts so that he could ""convince"" me that aborting the baby was the right thing to do and that he would kill himself if I didn't. He was Pro-life as well, which I found ironic. About a week later, I told him that it was done and told him how traumatizing the experience was for me. He then, had a meltdown. He said that he was scum and that he'd never forgive himself for the trauma he put me though and even offered me more money as ""compensation"" which I refused. He checked himself into a psych ward and haven't heard from him since. Last time we talked, he said he would kill himself as soon as he was done with the military.

It's been over a year since and I have since gotten a lot of therapy and realized that I allowed people to treat me like trash due to my low self esteem. I could could blame it on my abusive mother for teaching me that that's how I deserved to be treated but I still could've walked away from the abuse from my ex's at any point. I just thought I was abused because I deserved it. I now live a much more stable life with a great job, new friends, and a wonderful therapist. What I did still haunts me and I know I could never take it back. I still don't use Facebook and I am still single. I need to do more work on myself before I go into another relationship. I've been researching red-flags in relationships and also been learning to trust my gut about people. I know my worth now and refuse to settle for abusive assholes ever again.

I’m also the neighbour of a vile man and his much kinder wife (a vet) who I love less dearly. 

Anyway, my neighbour hates my dog and generally my family for one reason or another and has been since we moved in 5 years ago. 

He particularly hates my dog for some reason maybe because unlike him he is happy and has people that love him (but of course this is only a suggestion). 

Anyway, last month my dad was out of town at his brothers birthday celebration in Ireland and left the rest of the family back at home in our home country England. Now it is important to mention that my neighbour, henceforth known as EN - evil neighbour is scared of my dad and won’t try anything around him as my dad is tall and physically imposing whilst EN is 5’9” and thin is a blade of grass.

Anyway, my fool of a brother (I don’t blame him for what happened, he’s only 12 and made a mistake) accidentally left the back door unlocked whilst returning from walking the dog and none of us checked the door after. 

So that night at roughly 10:30 we heard an intense barking from my dog (who sleeps on an old mattress by the back door) barking and squealing in agony. All of us ran downstairs and saw our neighbour flash past the window and more horrifically our family dog with cuts all over, mostly of him snout, paws and hind legs. 

We were horrified and rushed him to an emergency vet where he spent about 4 days and eventually returned home with stitches and as a shadow of himself. 

We confronted our neighbour about it (my dad being home at this point) and he denied everything but we still saw him and knew it was him so commenced in our revenge. 

So you may remember me mentioning that his wife was a vet earlier in the story and this is where it comes in handy. As we took him to an emergency vet due to the late time the event happened at we hadn’t been to his usual vet; where EN’s wife worked...

We decided to make a follow up visit and once at the vet directly requested her, she was horrified to see the state of our dog and wanted to know what could’ve happened to him. 

We explained the whole story to her, talking about seeing EN and suspecting him, and her face turned pale white muttering something along the lines of “he wouldn’t...”

She basically told us that she caught him coming home late that night seemingly out of breath with dirty clothes and was suspicious. He was already a crummy husband and I think the suspicion of hurting an innocent animal pushed her over the edge

Was in a 24 hour coffee shop doing school work, went outside to take a piss. As I'm walking back, I notice 2 kids in full back clothing running across the street and almost get hit by a car. I shrug it off and continue walking back. As I get back to the entrance, some tall guy is panting and asks me if I can hear him, because I had my bluetooth earbuds in, said yes and he told me my laptop was stolen. 

I asked him if he was joking, he said no, he said he tried to grap the kid and tells me this as I'm walking back to my place. Lone behold my laptop is gone. The good samaritan had already talked to the manager of the place and they were already calling the local rent a cops. (Not your average rent a cops, these dudes had guns). They took my statement and then we all start waiting for the cops as the property security starts going through video surveillance. They find an ok pic of the kids face. I have to admit I'm dumbfounded the kid tried it here considering the place is nationally known and there are cameras everywhere. 

We sat around realizing no one actually called the cops, we called them, we all waited, they arrived. Cops got my statement and the witnesses. Then the manager comes out with the phone. Both the property security and the cops see what they can learn from the phone. (This is where it gets good)

So the kids phone is on a group chat via Instagram or something, his notifications keep popping up on the lock screen where everyone could read a bit of it, the group is literally talking about how the kid lost his phone. Whomever involved kept trying to call it. The property security is a chick so she goes into undercover mode, calls the number that called the kids phone, and pretends to be some innocent girl that found the phone. She proceeds to flirt w the boys, follows them on Instagram, shes like ""you're cute"", they say ""you too"" the dudes give her their numbers and such. She even got the type and color of car they were driving out of them. (They apparently parked off site and took off after). Turns out they wanted to meet on the other side of the city to collect the phone. Its at least 10 miles away. The conversation and such goes on for about an hour. All of the cops just huddled around the phone while the girl is flirting with them getting info. They finally catch on, girl is blocked etc. But.... she hits the home button.. ""hey siri, call mom"". The cops actually got to call the parents and next day or last night, went and talked to the dad. The kid lives a sub city away and now has a warrant. Oh, last detail, I just got the computer back from factory for repair that day so I had the serial number on the receipt. On top of that, it was a computer the school gave to me so hopefully I can get a replacement from them if the kids torched the lap top. Cop told me it's a matter of time before the kid gets picked up. 

It's a high school kid so I dont want him to have a record, but depending on the shape of my laptop, or revenge, probably gonna press charges, on top of the charges he has from stealing out of the coffee shop.

TLDR at the bottom.


This happened about a year ago. I had just returned from a business related trip to the frozen north (Canada) of which I had been gone for about 8 months. During this time my wife had kept me apprised of everything going on in the neighborhood, as well as her suspicion that our new neighbors behind us (henceforth known as DDN for Drug Dealing Neighbors) were dealing drugs. Since I'm all about keeping my family safe, I install security cameras all around and inside my house.


Most of my neighbors were perfectly fine with the cameras, and a few asked if I could set theirs up if they bought them. DDN, however, was not pleased. He waited until I was heading out to my car and confronted me, DEMANDING I take them down.


DDN: HEY! Take those mother-fin cameras down. I don't need no one knowin' my s!


Me: No. They're watching my property. Can't see into your yard at all.


DDN: Man, F*** YOU! Take those s***s down or I will!


Me: I ever see you on my property, you'll leave in a body bag.


At this point I know my wife's suspicions were well founded. I watched the camera feeds and started noting that he had a lot of quick visitors around 3 am. Cars would pull up in front of MY driveway, he'd meet them, exchanges were made and the cars would leave. Not too long after, I got a motion alert on 2 of my cameras and my dogs started going nuts. I saw my front door handle move. It's go time. I grab my shotgun and rush to the front door, but as soon as I tried opening it my beagle tried bolting outside, howling at the trespassers. Unable to deal with him AND properly hold a 12 gauge, I opt to keep my dog and yelled at the 2 men standing there to get the f*** off my property. That night, my motorcycle was stolen (they broke the locks off) and every camera on the ground floor had to be repositioned/ replaced. I checked the footage and watched as DDN walked up to them and hit them. I was done being a bystander.


I contacted the police, but even with security footage, they claimed there was nothing they could do. I was furious. I knew who did it, had the proof, and there was nothing I could do about it...yet.


For the next couple days I studied municipal and building codes. I started filling report after report on my DDN. Broken down cars in the yard, that's a violation. Broken gutters hanging off the roof, that's a violation. Barking dogs after 10pm, that's a violation. I nickel and dimed them for anything I could hoping to goad them in to doing something. I put tainted gas in a gas can on the back of my Jeep (which was unsurprisingly stolen) and suddenly their dirt bike engine blew up the next night. DDN confronted me again, threatening that if the complaints didn't stop, he couldn't guarantee my dogs or my wife would be safe. Heated words were exchanged, he stormed up to me, and the encounter ended with weapons drawn and both of us going back inside our homes. Finally, the coup de grace: remember the security footage of DDN's late night visitors? I filed a report with the Counter-Narcotics Division and included EVERYTHING. License plate numbers, car models and colors, all the information I'd gathered for the past few months. They got enough security footage for a search warrant, and the other evidence made sure it wasn't a ""friendly"" visit.


I got to watch the security cameras as SWAT descended on their house. I got to see DDN and everyone else led out in handcuffs. I later found out that the dogs I had called about were being bred and used as bait dogs. The police confiscated a small arsenal and enough drugs that those assholes won't be out of jail until I'm retired.

Well this happened about 3 weeks ago. For context  fb guy is guy, and motorcycle thief is well thief. My motorcycle is a bashan bsr (for those who don’t know its a Chinese dual sport motorcycle). I start Monday morning off blurry eyed and half conscious to go to work. I leave my bike on the front porch because I never expected anyone to steal the ducking thing. Anyway I trudge through Monday and get home at about 5pm, as I pull up I notice something odd. My porch seems awfully barren for some reason and it hits me like a truck. My wife greets me at the door and I asked her “honey where is my bike?” as the color drains from her face she says “oh please no”. Not wanting to believe it I check my shed thinking I just forgot I put it back there. Ta dah, no bike there either. I immediately call the fuzz to file a report. Our chief rolls up and gets my info, pics of the bike, vin, ect. (At the time I had a security camera system but hadn't installed it yet). After he leaves, I feel defeated and go and set in my house and stew on in for a few minutes. I have a neighbor across the way from me that has a bike on his porch too. Not wanting him to go through the same thing as me, I casually walk over and lay down what happened. As we talk he points to a camera in the corner of his carport that points at my house. He says give me a bit and ill hunt down the footage of the thief snatching your bike. Feeling a bit relieved the there maybe footage of this porch pirate grabbing my bike, I go home, he comes and gives me the footage a bit later. In my desperation, I post on fb a reward for anything that gets my two wheels of fun back to me (knowing my local Arkansas police dept I would never see the thing again). I go to bed feeling sick about the whole situation. I crawl into work the next day and fb messenger pings my phone to life with a new message. Low and behold a guy gets a hold of me and sends me pics of the guy trying to trade my bike for his(he turned him down). We talk for a minute and I thank him for the info. A few minutes later a brilliant Idea pops into my head. Que sneak mode, I message guy back and ask if he would be willing to work with me on setting up a time for his “friend that was wanting a cheap bike” to buy said bike from thief. Guy says “sure I'm down with that”. They go back and forth and thief agrees to a meet and greet with guys friend “Adam”. Thief isn't the smartest cookie in the bunch and sends me the wrong text app number and I never hear from him. No text, call nothing, about 6 hours passes and I message guy back and tell him thief never responded. Guy messages thief back as says “Adam” messaged you and he said you never said anything. Thief asks for “Adams” number, he calls. I pick up the phone calm and collected but know ill end up breaking down quick with rage if I don’t get in and out. Thief says he has had it for about 2 months, I agree to buy the bike and meet in a big public place at 12 the next day. Feeling like im gonna nail him I call and tell my boss what was going on and get the day off for the next day. Next day rolls around, I call my dad to borrow his truck so I can meet the guy in a vehicle he has never seen (considering he looked at my truck and my wife's car). I make it to town and call the local police and ask them to send a cruiser and tell them the situation. The cop takes my info and gives me his number and hides behind a building and tells me to text him when he pulls up. The waiting game starts and im nervous, feeling like I could have spooked him at any time during our interaction on the phone. I wait for an hour at the parking lot im at and the cop says he cant stay there any longer. I message the cop and tell him thank you for your time. I have my wife message some of her old friends from back in the day to see if they can get a bead on him. She gets a hit from one of her friends saying thief came to them and asked them to help him sell the bike (Thief had another stolen bike with a pic and showed a shed with some background I recognized). Her friend says he may have the bike stashed at thief's dads house and I drive back to my hometown. I proceed to skim my hometown in the sketcher part of town but come up with nothing. Im to the point of giving up but decide one last push for anything. I pull up thief’s fb profile(he has about 3) and manage to find out who his dad is and he uses fb messenger. I don’t want his dad tipping off thief but im out of options. But I relent and call thief's father on fb messenger and he picks up. I tell him everything and he is super nice, I tell him I'm not mad or spiteful to you but I just want my property back from his son. He agrees and apologized profusely, he tells me he will call him and tells him to give it up (I didn’t believe for a second thief would do that). I go home and wait. About an hour later I receive a message from thief's dad asking me for my number for his son to call me. About 5 minutes later I received a call from thief, I am in utter disbelief. He gives me a sob story, to which I just keep saying OK where is my bike? He sends me text of the address of where he left the bike. I pack back up and head back to town and call the towns pd again and they have two cruisers meet me and escort me to the location. When I say im nervous in this part of town that is an understatement. We get the bike and my wife tells me she physically seen my stress leave my body. We load the bike up and head back home. But the story isn't finished, this whole time I had been been keeping the my hometown pd informed on everything. Chief calls me and asks “do you want to press charges, my suggestion is don’t let him have any slack” Duck yes I do. I head to the pd and sign an affidavit against thief for thief by receiving and criminal mischief. (I have messages guy screenshot of him trying to trade/sell the bike) I sign the papers and get home to do damage control. Thief ripped apart the ignition to get it started, and took a screwdriver to the gas cap. Pissed but happy the bike is back with me I lock the bike up and order new parts and forget about him. About a week later I get the urge to check local records and see if they have picked him up. Boy did they, added a felony to his rap sheet and I burst into laughter seeing his mug shot. Thank you all for reading, I will try to get some pics uploaded of the damage he had did. I give anyone permission to use this story for whatever.

on my tablet so hope this turns out ok.

This happened to me a few years ago, I had recently moved to the north of Scotland where I now live and was staying with my mum and stepdad while getting a house sorted, they went away on holiday for a fortnight so missed all the fun.

I came home from work one afternoon (started at 0400 and finished at 1330) to find a car blocking the driveway into my house! Having a small car, I parked at the top of the drive blocking them in (my parents live out in the sticks on a single track road so I couldn’t leave my car where it was because I would have been blocking the road).

After an hour I saw someone approaching the drive and taking pictures of my car!! I went out and confronted them and the conversation went like this.

Me.. why are you taking pictures of my car?

EP.. because your parked illegally and blocking my car in, I’m going to call the police if you don’t move your car from my neighbour drive!

Me.. this is my clearly parents drive, did you not think it was odd having to walk out of someone’s garden to get into neighbour?

EP.. well it wasn’t very clear so can you move so I can get out.

So I get my keys and move, then park my car and think nothing of it

Next morning I leave for work and once again I find the same car parked in my parents drive! This time I go knock on my neighbours door and ask him to get his friend to shift it... only for my neighbour to ask “what friend”? I pointed to the car and told him what had happened yesterday, turns out the prat wasn’t his friend at all but liked to walk round the woodland path near our houses.

20 minutes later he finally appears, smirks and moves before saying

EP.. I’ll be parked here tomorrow too

So once again I go to work at stupid o’clock and when I get back, lo and behold, the prat has parked their again! This time I decided to teach him a lesson, I had 2 days off so I went to the shops and got some shopping and a rather large amount of alcohol (Strongbow and Savannah dry cider if your interested), got home, parked as close to his car as I could, making sure I was safely off the road.

I went inside, made some dinner and started drinking, about an hour later there’s a banging on the door.

Me.. yes

EP.. move your car it’s blocking me in and my family want to go home.  I look out and there’s his rather embarrassed looking family sitting in their car.

Me.. sorry can’t (as I took another drink from my cider) been drinking for a couple of hours, probably over the limit so I don’t want to risk it.

EP.. WHAT!!!! Why are you drinking when you knew I’d be wanting to move my car

Me.. I’m off for the next 2 days so I fancied a drink

EP.. I’M CALLING THE FUCKING POLICE

Me.. you do that.  Before shutting the door and popping into the lounge to watch tv while also watching them through the window.  About 2 hours (apparently they police had trouble finding my house lol) later the police arrive and speak to EP before they knock on my door.

Me.. yes officers how can I help

PO1.. why are you stopping EP from leaving? So I began explaining the events of the previous days and mentioned how I’d told him he couldn’t park here, I also explained that I had been drinking and was probably over the limit so I couldn’t risk moving my car!

PO1 &amp; 2 agreed that I was correct to not drive while intoxicated, they then asked what insurance I had. I pointed out that it’s was named driver only (basically means that only people who’s name is on the insurance can drive my car) so they couldn’t move it for me.

EP.. COME ON JUST MAKE HIM MOVE HIS CAR

PO2.. just going to get the breathalyser... blow into this please (to me)... your about 2 times the legal limit, so I’m sorry but you can’t move your car

PO1.. (to EP) sorry but he’s over the limit, you’ll have to leave your car here and come back tomorrow 

EP.. WHAT! But how are we meant to get home

Me.. bus stop about 2 miles down that road, you’ll get the bus to (insert city) at this time, or (insert town) at this time 

EP.. but the bus doesn’t go anywhere near where we live...

PO2.. We can call you a taxi if you want, but you’ll need to pay for it

EP.. he did this deliberately! 

Me.. yup lol

Fast forward to the next day the police arrive with him in their car and before they ask me to move my car they decided to have some fun

PO1.. we just want to check you with the breathalyser again... big deep breath... 

EP looking more and more worried 

PO2.. your fine, can you move your car please 

Me.. of course officers 

PO1.. to EP.. don’t park your car here again

EP couldn’t even look at me, just got in his car and drove off, later that day I decided to build a gate for my parents

One on first and one on second shift. I won't go into details about the the first shift job. But my second shift job I was the only person out of both shifts who loaded what they called *exports* or floorload containers of frozen chicken that were shipped over seas to other countries. 

I didn't necessarily need this job, but it was extra income, so why not? Well, recently there was an office manager, we'll call him Bob, who was promoted to Ops manager. Bob comes in on second shift one night, very unusual, but he wanted to see how second shift ran. 

Bob sees me loading the export container and gets all heated and frustrated that I was *loading it wrong*. I clearly know I wasn't loading it wrong but I asked him how he wanted me to load it then, considering I'm the only person out of the entire warehouse on both shifts who loads exports, and have been doing this job for a year. For reference I was loading it in the way the company standards stated me to and the way I was trained. He gets heated after I asked that question and says *Think of it yourself and fuck off*. 

Okay, cool, I didn't appreciate that remark, but I let it slide. I changed the way I loaded the exports in a way I thought he wanted me to load (considering he never actually stated how he wanted me to load) and Bob comes in again a week later. Bob sees me loading the export container and asks why I'm loading it the way I was. I explained to him i was loading it differently because he told me to. 

Bob told me to *fuck off* and load it the way I was the other night. I get off my forklift, take off my badge, hand it to bob and say *Fuck off Bob, load it yourself*. I head upstairs, take off my freezer suit and leave anything related to the company in my locker. 

I had four exports to load that night, I was halfway through the first load, with nobody else knowing how to load exports. I go home, shut my phone off and go to sleep. I wake up the next day relieved and rested. I get a call a week later asking me to come back because they have nobody to load the exports, nobody knows how to and that they really needed me. Nope, if you're gonna treat me like a piece of shit then I'll do the same. 

Bob tried showing his dominance as the newly promoted Ops manager, but he did it in the completely wrong way. Don't tell me to fuck off. I may let it slide once, but when you tell me to fuck off twice, then I'm done. It's unprofessional.

It was 2007 and we were in our last year of high school. I was in a relationship of 2 years with a hot, cute, nice guy. Everything was smooth and nice until he started to be controlling and aggressive, and we used to fight every other day. One day he got to the point that he physically threatened me, not really hit me but violently pinned me down while having an argument. I finally had enough and dumped him right away.

The following weeks were all about him begging me: flowers, cute romantic playlists on a CD, pathetic scenes with him on his knees crying and begging me to forgive him, even his mother called me to let me know he wasn't eating, all the jazz. Luckily, I was adamant about not wanting to be in that kind of relationship but he really seemed penitent and willing to go back to ""normal"". 

One day my best friend came to me, had me sit down and handed me some papers. 
The day before he was at a friend's house, and mistakenly logged into our friend's little sister (15yo, we were 17) MSN. He saw a conversation with my ex, got suspicious and went through it. He printed out 50+ pages of the worst shit. The girl had a huge crush on him. He lured her into sneaky conversations, and some day they hooked up. Eventually he began to blackmail her saying that if she wouldn't give him bjs he would have told everybody and expose her like a big slut. 

Here's how I handled it:

1. I began to search for ""hot"" chat rooms, explicitly flirt with the weirdest guys I could find and give them ""my"" number to have some sexting. I think he got at least 20 dickpics in a couple of weeks, plus some creepy calls. Eventually, he had to change his number;

2. I sneaked into his house (his mother insisted that I got a spare key because she was often out of town and he wasn't very reliable, and I hadn't returned it yet) and proceeded to spread a whole pack of stinky cheese under his mattress (hopefully the smell would have worsened a lot before he could have it figured out); 

3. I put a few drops of super glue into his motorcycle key slot, just enough to have the key stop before reaching the right position to work;

4. As a grand finale, I got in touch with that poor girl, we had a talk, and we managed to team up. We even reached out to his ex (I was slightly suspicious about something going on with her but I thought I was being paranoid... Nope, I was right, he repeatedly tried to hit on her but she rejected him and was super annoyed). We went out to dinner, the three of us, like old friends... At the diner he was working at. We pretended we didn't know him the whole time, but we brought along all the conversations printed out and spent the night reading them aloud and laughing, discussing about what a douchebag he was right in front of him, while he had to act normally since he was working. 

Eventually (since we were in a small town and most of the people he used to hang out with were in my group of friends), he moved with his sister, in another town, right after high school graduation.

This apartment was new but had been vacant for the better part of two years, and came with two parking spaces right near the entrance of the underground parking, pretty much in front of the main ramp.

The thing is that since the apartment had been empty for a while, most people assumed those spaces were visitors parking, unassigned spaces that people used when visitors came or when they needed to unload something. They where always assigned to the apartment, just that since no one lived there, no one cared. Until we moved in.

At first, some people accused us of invading those parking spaces, claiming that they didn't belong to us, and that we could not use them. They filled complains, which where dismissed by the administration. However something different started happening, we started seeing cars invading our parking spaces. At first we didn't complain and didn't think much of it. Change is hard for some people, right?

After a while we filed a complain expecting something to happen. The administration also dismissed it, saying that ""they are looking into the problem""

After like a month my dad had enough. Atleast once a week he had to street park because some moron had taken over his parking space. But not today. 

For a bit of context, these parking spaces are two parallel parking spaces, where you park one car in front of the other. (I can dig up a picture if this isn't clear) so this we where at the mall. When we arrived home, this Kia truck is sitting in our parking space. Annoyed, we did what we always had to do, go to the security desk, to get them to call the owner so they would move their car. 

So they called up the guy, who went pretty much ""I don't understand what the problem is. That is public parking. I'm going to file a complain against whoever is saying they own that parking space because it's a lie. They are stealing and I'm going to make them pay. Can you tell me the name of whoever is asking me to move my car? Because I'm also going to talk with my lawyer too, and with the administration, because this can't continue happening""

So, in a fit of rage, my dad took his truck, parked it right in front leaving just a couple of inches between his rear bumper and the Kia truck, leaving it there, with no space to pull it out. And then left. The guard just looked at him with the ""I don't get paid enough to deal with this"" look and walked back to the security desk.

So 11pm came around and we hear our phone ringing

""The owner of the Kia truck is here and can't leave""

""Well he had the chance of leaving before. Tell him to file a complain""

And hung up.

12am comes by, people are knocking at our front door. They are getting desperate. You can hear them. Then 1am comes by, again our phone rings, this time it is the guard and the cops. That's our parking space, they can't tow our car. 

The next morning comes by and this guy is back, again knocking at our door saying that he is going to sue us. Oh well, I guess we are not going out today either. This was a Sunday. Monday rolls by, my dad leaves on my mom's truck, that Kia is still there. Wednesday comes by, and my dad gets a phone call, it's from the administration. They got the point and are pretty much begging my dad to let them get that truck out of there before stuff gets out of hand, they say that are going to get a sign made that says that it isn't visitors parking, and make sure there is a camera pointed at out parking so whoever parks there is on recording. My dad finally gives in and let's the guy move the truck, after 5 days.

I work with several companies and have a few books published. In short, literature is my bag. With that established, let's continue. 

I was just going through my old creative writing work from university and found my utter favourite group project! It was a lovely 7000 short story that me and my co-writer were to make for our course, all the way back in 2008. The story was to be a play on the standard hard-boiled detectives type of thing. 

Well... when I say that it was 7000 words, it was actually meant to be a 10000 word piece. That was the outline for the group project. The last few pages of the document, which I've kept all these years, are just screenshots of the email that my partner on the project sent me at 1am the night before the project was due to be handed in, ""Hey dude, what part of the work stuff do I still need to do? I didn't check, lol"", and my reply being ""your half of the work, like we discussed several times over the last few months.""

So yeah, I had written a good chunk more than my even share of the work. That email was then printed out, stapled into the print-out of the story, handed in, marked and graded! When our lecturer graded it, he mentioned that it had a 'disappointing ending' which was taken into account - I passed, and my partner did not.

Last spring, I finished my minor hockey career, meaning I’d have to enter the wild world of men’s league. In November, I joined a local hockey Facebook group to find a place to play. That evening, I saw a dude looking for players to have a casual game at a local arena, 10pm, Sunday night. I commented, was told the cost was 20$, deal, I was in. 

I showed up and was told I’d be playing on the white team. I noticed that all my teammates didn’t know each other, were wearing different jerseys and that the opposing team had matching custom orange jerseys, orange socks, they all got along just fine. We hit the ice, and it was instantly apparent that the orange team played together often. They had set plays, and passed around our team with ease. 

We thought we’d be showing up for a casual, no-contact game, but team orange was in it to win. They played hard, swinging their sticks at anyone who touched the puck, tripping players and taking plenty of penalties with no referee to call it. Eventually, they got bored of skating circles around a bunch of randoms, and starting trying to hit members of my team. I played all star hockey growing up, I naturally played with my head up, aware of my surroundings, but my teammates weren’t so lucky. Most of them were getting run over while the orange team laughed and mocked them. The game ended early when half of my team left, injured and realizing they’d paid 20$ to get run over and embarrassed by these guys.

I stuck around in the dressing room after, and made sure to ask lots of questions. I sat next to the team captain, and soon found out that the orange team was an actual beer league team, that played together every weekend. They played their league games on Saturday night, then rented the ice every Sunday night to “practice.” Their idea of practice was getting a team of randoms together via Facebook, advertising the session as a casual skate, then pummelling them for fun. He said that a lot of guys wouldn’t come back to play again, complaining about the hitting, saying the skate was not fun, and it was getting hard to find people to play, but he didn’t really care and found it funny, plus he was making a profit. 

After watching this guy and his team con 11 guys out of 220$ total, promise them a fun game, then beat them up, and play unfairly against them, I wanted to do something. I could’ve taken it up with the admin of the hockey group, that would be too easy and no fun. That weekend, I payed close attention to the Facebook group. Sure enough, on Friday night, the captain posted the same ad I saw last weekend. Within minutes, the comments were flooding with a handful of players, about to be tricked like I was. I quickly PMed all the players, notifying them of what this guy was up to, they were surprised, but thanked me for telling them. Sure enough, they all went back to the comments to cancel on him, using various fake excuses. The next day, the captain posted a desperate ad, followed by another on Sunday morning. Less and less people commented. Perfect.

I did this for a couple of weeks, messaging players and telling them to avoid this guy and his team, nobody snitched on me, and slowly he stopped posting in the group. Interested to see if he’d cancelled his practices altogether, I called the rink, and asked if the ice was booked on Sunday night at 10. The rink attendant said that a beer league team was practicing at that time, and it was the only open ice available for the winter. Learn to skate sessions were on weekend mornings, minor hockey games happened on weekend afternoons/evenings, and junior games happened on weekend nights, beer league games happened late night Saturday, and the beer league team always booked practice on Sunday night, nobody else wanted that time slot, and often went to other rinks. If it was the only open ice time, what if I went the extra step, and took it from them?

The orange team captain always booked his session on Friday nights, so I called the rink on Thursday night, hoping I wouldn’t be asked for a down payment, and asked to book Sunday night for the next month. I told the attendant that I was running an adult learn-to-skate session, fake name, fake company, everything. They gave me the time slots and told me I could pay on Sunday night, before the skate. I owned the slot now, and there was nothing that captain cuck could do about it. 

To avoid having to actually pay for the ice time, and to avoid being a no show, I’d call every Sunday morning, and cancel my session for that night, claiming my fake skating class couldn’t get any members to register. Cancelled ice time would become an open skating session, meaning that families, couples, anyone could pay a small fee and come skate, so the rink wouldn’t lose any money. Too late for the captain to be able to book his practice, but enough time for the rink to open a free skate session. After a month, I figured that the captain didn’t bother with trying to book Sunday night anymore, so I told the rink attendant that my learn to skate company flopped, and that I wouldn’t need to book Sunday night anymore. 

This whole fiasco lasted about a month and a half to 2 months, from November to January. Never heard from the captain or his team. He hasn’t posted in the group since, so I’m assuming that they don’t have their “practices” anymore. Last I heard, the 10pm Sunday night session was booked by a beginner adult league, where a lot of men and women were learning to play for the first time. I’d like to think that I’m partially responsible for the opening of that beginner league, if you’re out there and you’re learning to play because I stole ice time from a shitty beer league team, you’re welcome. I’ve found a new place to play, with a great group of guys.

This happened a little less than a year ago. We had a brand new professor that had never taught alone before. (This is college btw. She is roughly mid 30's to early 40's while the entire class is early 20's to late 20's.) And she was like a ticking time bomb. We never knew if she was gonna be in a good mood or a bad mood because both classes she taught were night time and she would come from her other job working for a large company.

When she was in a good mood, it was always a fake Disney-looking smile all the time and obvious fake laugh and when she was in a bad mood she would yell at students and insult student's work if she didn't like it.

She caused more than half of the class to have multiple mental break downs throughout the semester. (Including me who had to go on heavy anti-anxiety medication so I didn't have a breakdown and stop functioning normally.) She would grade based on all or nothing. If she didn't like it, you got a big fat 0 and couldn't resubmit after the final submission. She would also not tell us the full details of the assignment, then would get pissed when the class didn't complete what she wanted. She also would add details to assignments if she was in a bad mood and make the assignment stricter than it already was. She would get pissed if the class asked too many questions and would sound like she was gonna legit cry if students stood up to her. Like, her voice would start sounding shaky and would crack. And we would rarely stand up and if we did, we tried to be as respectful as possible because we all knew, if we are respectful and she's not, that helps our cause.

She also NEVER taught in either of the classes, it was always ""here is your assignment."" and the only time she even tried to teach was when the head of the program decided to sit in during the class after hearing all the things that have been happening. And even then, it was a crappy power point presentation that she just read word for word off the screen. And even with the head of the program there, she still thought it would be a good idea to yell at students in front of him which prompted me to have a break down and him chase after me after I bolted out of class. Which I explained my side of everything to him for an hour alone because I was one of the only students that had not spoken with him at the time. Which he was shocked to hear some of the things he had not heard from other students.

She also tried to scam the class into creating something for free for her brother's job and when we brought up that we should be paid for it, (We would be doing roughly $1500-$2000 worth of work for free and we were asking for $1000 split between a group of 5 students.) she told us that it should be an honor that our work was being used in the real world (""You'll be paid in exposure 4Head"") and that we don't need to be paid and that her brother was dedicating his ""precious"" time for us. But when we also brought up that the work of the students legally belongs to the college and she couldn't use it without paying for it, she got pissed and yelled at us.

Thankfully the entire class was talking with each other outside of class and talking with the head of our program and letting him know what's going on since he knows all of us by heart. She sadly couldn't be fired during the semester so we had to deal with her which for most of us, it was our last class before graduating. He assured us she wouldn't tank our GPA's right before we graduated and he was very understanding about our side of the situation.

I learned that she had to be asked to come back in order to continue working there, which the head of our program did not do. So thankfully she is no longer a professor making life miserable for students. And during the semester, according to students who aren't even doing the same program as us, she already had a reputation as one of the worst teachers at the college.

Also if she somehow happens to see this, I truly don't care, the way I worded this post, is me being nice to her. And if she doesn't want something bad written about her, maybe she should think twice about treating students poorly. And I really pray I never have to have another encounter with her ever again. Whether it be for teaching or professionally.

But I will end this with something good. Even though that semester was horrid for pretty much every student in the class. I made a lot of good friends and we all have strong bonds due to it and we all now have each others back when it comes to anything. :)

TL:DR - Horrible professor treated students like crap and was extremely unprepared to teach causing students to have mental breakdowns right before we all graduated.

Me

Mom

MF: My childhood Friend

MFF:My Friend's Father

Richard: The Theaf(not hes real name)

So long time ago when i was a little kid my Mom was in a pretty tough situatin. She devorced  and had to took care of me, my older brother and my litte brother, who has asperger so he needed special treetmant. My Father didn't left us but the devorce was so frash and so paniful, that he refused to help her, just us the kids. It was a wierd situation, becouse my Mom got costudy but she didn't want my fathers money, so she didn't got a much child suport. Long story short: My father made good, my mother was poor (of course my father always fighted ford costudy but thats a story for an other subreddit)

Anyway, at the time my Mom had a little store in a small town selling sewing machines but mostly used gadgets. She bought and sell stuff to make a living and if you want to make a living on that market, u have to make diels people, who you don't even want to contact if you have a right mind. There comes Richard in the picture. He was a petty theaf and a drogaddict, who always wanted to sell stuff to my mum( yes, probably some of them was stolen item, never asked my Mom,that she ever bought something from him, i like to belive no, and i never saw police officers in the store and i spent a lot of time in there at the time). So one time my Mom collected the cash from the cashier to take it to the bank, and unluky timeing, Richard comes in to ask some questions. He got a good opportunity to steal my Moms wallet, and her phone. Eventually my Mom Dind' press crarges but she managed to blackmail back some of the money and her phone, but she lost 1600 dollar worth of money. Needles to say, next tho debt what was mother owned to the bank at that time it was a really shock for our family but becouse we wherelittle we didn't know about this at that time.

Time is going forward and i'm going to highscool and too thing happens. Fist of all MF's house got completly destroyed! You MFF had thing called Recinklyng money. He alway borrow and loan money and i think this time he owend too much, so one of the guys he owned hired some dude to destroy his house in revange! Gues who was the lucky guy who got this job! Thats right, it was Richard! He never got cought by the police becouse of this, but he took a too many visits in MFFs Hamburger restorant and asking questions about the invastigation. After some time it was obvios that, that idiot did it, but there was not enough evedance to prove it. But now he got a biiiig enemy, and it didn't take a long time to now unveil Richards drogbuisniss. So enteully he was a stupid petty criminal and got 8 years in prison, for far not the worst thing he did. MFF had a contact, who had a contact in prison, who wrote latters in every month about the guys in the local buisnesses who got cought. That will be important later.

The second thing what happened is: My Mom finally come out of the deep and also got a knew husbend. A husbend who accidantly worked int the prisen as the second guy in the medical appartment. Becouse my Mom long ago took a nursing scool (Didn't finish it becouse of marrige) my new stepfather got her a new job in the medical apartment.

And now the revenge: At this point Richard almost lost all of his mind becouse of drugs (yes in prison too) and didn't recognise my Mom. I mean... he did but not quite. For some reason he tough she was her doctor out of town! He sad big hellos to her and sad to her things like ""Hey Doctor! Doctor! Do you recognise me? You where best doctor in town!"" ect. At one point my Mom lost, looked around it and the next conversation follow:

\-Richard shut up! I was not your doctor! I was never a doctor! You know me, becouse one time you robbed me, so don't try my patiens!

\-But... no... no i never...

\-Yes you did! Now shut up and go back to your place.

Richard was in shocked, locked down to the ground and obayed. Now there is one imprtant rule in the prison: Be friends with everyone in the medical apartment, becouse, they have all the medicine, and drugs! So two really big guy heard the conversation (such as everyone,it was loud :D ) and went to my Mom and they asked:

\- Should we... you know... revard him?

My Mom looked around. No guards nerby. She quiatly answeard:

\- You can.. just little. 'Wink.

The two guys noded, and when the guards came back this two guy standed around Richard all time when they leaved the medical apartment.

Do you remeber the letter thing? Well a little time pass and in a conversation between me and MF somehow come up Richard. He sad to me this:

Well, two weeks into her being there, I had found out that one of my best friends during highschool that had moved away was going to have a baby. I spent hours, *days*, hand sewing the cutest little dino plushy for my friends baby. When I came back after going out with a different friend, I found the ladys dog on the floor with the torn up plush. I flipped. I screamed, scaring the dog off, and gathered it all up. The landlords daughter faked innocence asking ""oh, was that yours? Well, you shouldn't have just let it laying around."" 

It had been in a box in my room, on a shelf that I needed a stool to reach. 

So, I tell my landlord, and he asks me to just let it go. She's going through some things, and she'd be leaving in a couple months anyway. But I couldn't do it. I had to spend more money to pay for more material, and now I couldn't trust that she wouldn't ruin that one either. So I came up with a plan. 

She left her dog alone in the house at night when she'd go out and party. And she had a suitcase that had most of her stuff in it. One weekend while she was out, I went into her room, and flipped open the suitcase. And I just... Left. The dog was in there, so my work was already done. I went to bed. 

Next morning, I wake up to my landlords daughter *screaming*. Her dog must had *really* wanted to chew shit up, because every single thing she had in that suitcase was destroyed. Clothes, hair dryer, toiletries, adult toys. All of it, smashed and broken and torn up. Because she had taught her dog it was okay to chew on my things, her dog chewed on *everything*. Then, she tried to beat her dog. My landlord got pissed. He gave her a verbal thrashing as said she had to leave, within a week, and he was keeping the dog. She tried to get out of it, but she did eventually leave. 

I loved out a year later, and now rent from one of my other family friends. My old landlord still has the dog. I did end up remaking the plushy for my friends baby, and finished judt in time.

He’s an idiot with a micro penis, so he owns a big dumb F150 with light bars and a big fat unnecessarily loud exhaust. I’m a car guy and I love a loud exhaust, but dudes with jacked trucks that don’t even see gravel roads are idiots. He didn’t even work on the truck himself, just bought it that way from some other idiot.  

The problem is that he has remote start....and uses it like an idiot. Every single time he starts his truck he lets it sit there idling forever. Like most instances the truck idles so long that it times out and turns off, then he remote starts it again for another cycle.   Idiot. 

He leaves for work at 4am. Home by like noon every day. Then he spends the rest of the day going out, coming back. Going out, coming back. Never gone for more than half an hour at a  time. Usually he’s only gone for 5 or ten minutes, dropping one of his kids off somewhere, or picking his wife up from the corner. Anyway.... every single time, same thing,  idling. Doesn’t matter what time of day, or year. Winter or summer.  His exhaust literally rattles the crystal in my dining room and pictures in my living room. I want to murder him. So does my wife. But we can’t do that. Trying to be nice and civil and not argue. 

He also has an 80s Cutlass that is his pride and joy. It’s literally worth $800. His brakes failed last year and he smashed the front end. Insurance wrote it off and he bought it back for like $600.  He’s that kind of idiot. He stores the Cutlass in one of those tarp tent garages. He has two of them, right on the edge of our properties. They don’t last long. Since I’ve lived here (7 years) he’s gone through about 8 of them because they keep getting wrecked in one way or another. One time the tent garage flipped over his fence onto my new van because it wasn’t secured. Insurance was involved.  A couple other times they’ve blown down the road. He’s that kind of idiot people. I can’t even explain. 

I just realized this post got long. I want to get back at him in some way that he won’t know it’s me. My best idea is to somehow disable his remote starter. He’s too dumb to ever fix it. Or like another remote to turn it off once he’s started it, but that’s probably not possible. 

I’ve tried to be nice and said things like ‘Man, my walls are rattling’ and he laughs like a thick skulled idiot and that’s it. I don’t even want to talk to him anymore, he’s so dumb.

For background, I work in a very competitive part of the service industry. It's a large enough community, but at the same time it's small enough where someone somewhere in the industry knows you, so it's important to not burn Bridges as one day you might find yourself In a disadvantageous position. 

I was in my position for a good 3 years as middle management, no call outs, never late, always stayed after to help my team out, worked on projects that belonged to my bosses, etc. Except for ONE DAY which I had gotten in a car accident (I was working the night shift and it was raining, this is important later in the story) and was unable to go into work as my car was undrivable and I had to wait for tow truck, insurance, and trying to find a ride late night/early morning was very difficult.  

At the time, my director had been let go and there was a blood bath, pissing contest to see who would get his promotion. For heiriarchy purposes it's my director, my direct bosses all on same level of authority (3 of them) then me. One of the direct bosses (let's call him DB) decided he was getting the promotion and started shaking our department. Restructuring projects, changing people's shifts, taking credit for other people's work, he was a real pain. 

About a few weeks of this, he had decided to switch me from morning shifts (which I had gotten due to my seniority in the team) into night shifts. I didn't make a stink because we were very short handed (also important) and the team needed help as we had newer members who had children, and I understood how this could affect their life. Fast forward a few more weeks and I get into the car accident which made me call out. This didn't sit well with him as I had made the team suffer because of my irresponsibility (lol what?). I didn't think much of it since I knew it was stressful and people tend to say things they don't mean under stress. 

Soon after that I met some higher ups from another department, they offered me a job in a new venture the business was exploring. I was a good candidate because of my experience and work traits. Of course I agreed as this would be a promotion in position and salary, plus my network of contacts would put me in a position to grow even further. I went through a series of interviews (3 in total) and I was given the opportunity to take the position, I signed my paperwork and shook the hand. 

A couple of days later HR called me saying the position was rescinded, and that it shouldn't come as a surprise. I was shocked and asked for a meeting to understand the decision. 

Queue the day of the meeting, I walked in and HR is sitting in the meeting room with DB. After the cordialities, DB explains that he blocked my promotion because I had attendance issues (which I had one call out due to my accident) and HR chimed in saying this shouldn't deter me from applying again in 6 months (lol ok). I accepted defeat because I still needed my job, and I didn't want to paint a Target on my back. 

A couple of days later a friend of mine that worked close to DB had told me DB had made the comment that he didn't want to let me go because I would leave the night shift uncovered, and no one would easily accept that shift. I was furious, but decided to not act on it, as I explained earlier it's a small enough business. 

A few months later the competition opened up close enough that a few people left to go there. I was one of them, I was hired by an amazing boss who I am still friends with years after. He offered me a great position and a huge raise in salary. For heiriarchy purposes it was my boss then me and my counterpart then our assistants. 

I had heard through the grapevine that DB had gotten rejected from the director position and was leaving the company. About a week or so later I was looking at new hires with my boss to fill out my counterpart position. My boss calls me and says, hey look this guy comes from the company you came from. To my delight I saw DB's name. I had been hiring people to the assistant positions from previous company, so I guess DB thought he was next. 

I told my boss the story about DB and how he blocked my promotion. All my boss said was TBNT (thank you but no thank you). We didn't even give him an interview. Looking back at it, we should have given him the interview and just said no, it would have made it sweeter.

I don't know if I did it right!

So this is a throw-away account because people may start their deduction magic and know personal info if I share this from main account. TL;DR at the bottom.

A little introduction: I am a web developer with CS and marketing degrees, and I was a CEO of a medium-large company for a good period in the early 2010s. These days, with money not a problem, and my previous experience, I pick and choose my clients and provide strategic planning, growth advice, and sometimes even lead web dev projects.

In early September, I was introduced by an acquaintance to a promising little SAAS company/startup. I did some research and was impressed with their work and product.

Their problem was that since about one and a half years they've been stuck. Same products, same growth, same employees. Everything was stagnant and the company was running out of time with their investors, and tension was coming through between the founders. It was still profitable, but it has plateaued and everyone was cranky and a bit tense. 

I thought it's not a good pay but they seemed like decent people, plus it's a good opportunity to meet some innovative pople and maybe, who knows, I invest in it myself.

We first met in November, where I introduced myself and jumped straight in. I did not waste any fucking time at all. I ran a 1 hour presentation I had prepared with all my own research, about what I think is wrong and needed to change. I pointed out flaws in the structure of their website, the structure of the organization, problems with marketing, flaws in SEO, hell even security flaws.

They were so impressed they basically told me just tell us the number. 

This would seem like a perfect outcome of the introduction, but since I have been in this exact situation before, and dealt with people like that before (unofficial, TELL US THE NUMBER MESSIAH type people), an alarm rang in my brain.

I took the initiative, and asked for a 3 month trial period only. I also told them I will not be making any type of work, answering any calls related to work, or offering any advice before we document our agreement with a legally binding contract. I don't think they liked that.

After a couple of weeks of trying to act like the contract thing did not exist (2nd alarm bell), they finally provided a minimal contract after I explicitly asked what happened regarding the contract. It was obviously written on the same day by one of the founders (3rd alarm bell) but hey, it says what I wanted it to say, so whatever. I signed the contract and we got to work.

I go full in, and I mean that. I really liked the project. I layed out a 3-month plan, with each month clearly laid out and detailed. And I explained that unless month 1 was done, we cannot move on to month 2 and 3 because each month's plan depends on the previous.

For example, they did not even have in their CRM a way to track the effectiveness of sales employees or marketing campaigns. Even their god-damned Google campaigns did not have conversion tracking. So, how the hell can we start a webinar marketing campaign if you can't know how much income it made you after the spend? You know? You just can't skip month 1.

You probably expect what happened now. I deliver the plan, tell them I'm available for questions/help, and go back home (about 600 miles away). I show up a month later (we agreed to meet physically once a month), and literally just the most basic shit was done. They hadn't sent many emails, and I asked 3-4 times during this month about how work was progressing, and I was assured it's going swimmingly fast.

When I see that, having wasted an entire day of driving, I go ballistic. I tell them in no uncertain terms that they need to get their shit toegether if they want everyone here to still have a job in 4-5 months when the investor finally gets bored with their incompetence, and go home.

Now, since this obviously means our 3-month plan will not be finished in 3 months, I told them - out of good faith - and to not be a burden on the same system I'm trying to make more efficient, that I will NOT be requring any payment for December, eventhough I am still available with all my resources to their use, even visit them if required. This also means the 3-month trial will be evaulated in February, instead of January.

This time, having learned what type of people I'm dealing with, I ask for permission to be directly responsible for implementation of the changes, this means direct authority over devs and designers. Permission granted.

We start good work for about 2 weeks, before devs suddenly stop replying on Whatsapp. I call the founders and they literally tell me: ""Listen, some of the stuff you ask is just a waste of time for our devs, we do things because of your CV, but we are not sure it needs to be done"".

For the web devs here, here are some of the things they say are stupid:

* Not having the server literally in the founders house
* If you are stupid enough to do #1, not having Cloudflare to hide your IP and protect agains DDOS
* Website not indexable by Google because dev did not fix the Angular indexing issues
* Site is https, but hey it just works if you remove the S
* CRM not ip restricted, is suspicable to SQL injection!

At this point, I started to zoom out and think if this shit is worth it. They're clearly not going anywhere with this type of mentality. Actually, I wondered just how the hell did they survive yet.

I told them, as per the contract I managed to get them to burp out, that I wll not be continuting my work. So, pretty please pay me for November only (8,000 USD) and let's be done with it. 

Founder #1 stopped showing read receits on Whatsapp after this message.

Founder #2 was called several times, and finally responsed on Jan 22nd, telling me that ""their accountant did not pay quarterly taxes so their account is frozen, and payment can only be made after"". He disappeared after, but what he did not know was that founder#3 had already told me that ""since one of their employees had a car accident that is not covered by insurance, the company had to chip in wih $40,000 to bail him out, and so it's difficult at the moment. Your payment will be in your bank by Feb 1, 100%"". Founder #3 has since also disappeared.

It was obviously all bullshit, and they had no intention of paying. Even one of the good devs called me and told me they're bluffing and they look at my messages on their Whatsapp in their office, show it to each other and start laughing at me for asking to be paid since I have obviously ""done nothing"".

Anyway, since I was assured that the payment would be paid by the 1st of February, and the call is recorded, I stopped contacting because it was obvious that I'm going to sue and win. 

This is quite a predictable post isn't it. You know what happens on Feb1, and 2nd, and 3rd? Nothing. Nothing happened. So, you guessd it, I sued.

What I did not expect myself, is that my lawyer is quite the Redditor. He told me ""Are you stupid or what you daft prick?"" (happens to be my friend as well).

""What?"" I asked

""Why in the holy fuck are you suing for $8,000 only, don't you want to make them pay the asshole tax?""

""Sure thing, buddy"" - me

So we sued for:

1. $8,000 for November
2. $8,000 For December
3. $4,645 for the partial part of January
4. Late fees, legal costs, compensation fees, and hurt feelings (don't know how to translate this one but trust me it's a real law)

The suckrs called me within 15 minutes of delivering the letter, after not replying for a month. They begged me to accept $8,000 and told me it was just a money problem at the company. I asked them to speak to my lawyer only, since I don't want to say something stupid.

He takes no shit from anyone, and told them just get a lawyer and see you in small claims court. They continued their douchebaggery by not actually showing up to court. Judge ordered them to pay $34,145, which I now have half in my account, and the other half in a ""golden cheque"". I don't know how it's called in the USA, but this never bounces, as long as you cash it on the specified time.

What is most satisfying is that since the last time we spoke, on Jan 22nd, I haven't heard a single thing from them. Not a whisper. So not only did I get my money, I did not have to see or deal with these assholes again.

TLDR at the end.

A while back I met a guy on Tinder named ""Q"", and I feel in love HARD. We had everything in common, we had good families and good ideals. Sex was great, and I really saw myself going long-term with this one. He texted me every day, multiple times a day. We were constantly talking about everything under the sun. 

... but 4 months passed, and he shockingly breaks up with me for being ""too gay"". I am pretty feminine-acting, and so is he. But he also told me **""I want someone who is 6'3, Super Manly, and Super Muscular.... you will never be any of those things... so I want to end it.""**

I am crushed. The next few months I decide to stay friends, we still text every day. He did a LOT of shit that was very much in the vein of ""leading me on"" for a few months. Example: He brings me to a dinner-dance to which I am SO HOPEFUL that he will get back with me. He kissed me at the end of the night, but told me ""Oh... the scenario just felt right, and it was cute and picturesque for me... but I have no feelings for you still."" I go home, and just ghost him. We dont talk for another 5 months. 

After 6 months, he messages me, saying ""I am so wrong, you were so good for me, I want to try again."" I was head over heels, so I said yes. Things are great again for 3 months, he asks to be ""official"", and I say yes.... life is good.

**NOW HERE's WHERE ITS FUN:**

I go to the mall to buy him a Christmas gift. I see him in the mall with another man. They dont have close body language. I take a photo from a distance and send it to him, saying I got it from a friend who worked in the mall. He comes to my house immediately saying, ""Oh, its just an old co-worker I wanna catch up with...no need to worry!""   I said fine.... but I knew it wasnt right.

The next week, he comes over, and breaks up with me. I asked if the guy in the mall was an co-worker, he said ""No, it was a date....but that date was terrible so I lied to cover it up.... but there is a SECOND guy who I've been seeing for a month and Im leaving you for him."" We break up, and I never talk to him again.

Two months later, I match with a guy named ""B"" on tinder. We go on a first date, I mentioned where I worked, and later at night, he texts me, ""We need to talk.... I used to date ... I lurked your instagram and saw an old photo of you two.""  We compared timelines, and it turns out, ""Q"" actually LEFT me for ""B"".   ""B"" Later tells me he broke it off with ""Q"" after dating for 3 weeks because there was no chemistry, they had nothing in common, and found ""Q"" to be super controlling and weird. ""Q"" texted ""B"" for a month after ""B"" ended it, because ""B"" is very much hot. Tall, muscular, manly, educated .... everything ""Q"" wanted in a man. ""Q"" was begging for ""B"" to come back and try again with him. ""B"" blocked him after a few weeks.

... anyway, fast forward 3 years, me and ""B"" are still dating. We have a house, and a dog, and just appeared in a Canadian wedding magazine together. The ultimate kicker?  My boyfriend, ""B"", is 6'3, super manly, and super muscular.... so I ended up with everything that ""Q"" wanted.   Its the perfect ""love/revenge"" story... but I truly am in love with ""B""... and I'm happy!

They ruined my life, I was immediately labelled and none believed me, they just read a couple of half sentences to get a quick idea and that was all.

I will move with my cellphone home so that my position won't be tracked in their place. I will use clothes I never use and leave my car far from her place in case there were cameras. 
I will use a hat and eyeglasses to cover my face in case of cameras or testimonies. There will be no proof that it was actually me.
I will start with small things like leaving in her garden small dolls with face painted like this :( or red eyes... Something creepy. Then I will leave other creepy messages like ""I am always watching you"" (even if that is not true). I will always be very cautious and my words will be general. No proof will be against me. If asked... I was home sleeping. If they will place some cameras they will see a guy covered with clothes I do not have at home.
Then I will follow her and scratch her car, cut her tires and this several times. I paid her 25k euros so she has plenty of money to fix them.
Then the big final... I will go to her door in the night, completely covered with a dark cloth, ring her door bell and since she has the window of her bedroom facing the door street she will look through it and see a bit black figure with raised hand with finger pointed.
Then I put that finger on my throat and leave a note saying ""I will take you, torture you and kill you burning you alive in a big oven i prepared just for you, one day: enjoy the waiting. Wherever you go I will be there"". I know it is gross and creepy and that is just what I want. 
Then I will leave as fast as I can, drop the black cloth in some trash nearby  and just leave the place walking. When police will come, if she called it, I will be far.
So she will live the rest of her life in fear. As she said she was, lying... Scared for her life. Now she will have a real reason to.
Maybe she will think about me  but she will have no proves at all that it was me and you know... Without proves you cannot do much.  In the end, world is full of creeps, he could be another man. Or an ex boyfriend or whatever.

This story goes through on a lifetime and it took a long time for me to put together all the pieces.

The cast:

Me and my mom 

MF: my childhood friend

MFF: my friend's father

Richard: the thief (not his real name)

So long time ago when I was just a little kid, my mom was in a pretty tough situation. 

She divorced and had to take care of me, my older brother, and my litte brother (who is autistic, therefore he needed special treatment). My father didn't leave us, but the divorce was so fresh and painful that he refused to help my mom, but he took care of us, the kids. It was a weird situation, because my mom got custody but she didn't want any of my fathers money, therefore she didn't get much alimony.

Long story short: my father made a decent living, my mother was poor (of course my father was always fighting for costudy but that’s a story for another subreddit).

Anyway, at the time my mom had a little store in a small town selling sewing machines, but mostly used gadgets. She bought and sold stuff to make a living and if you want to make money on that market, you have to make bargains with all kind of people, including the kind of people who you don't even want to contact in real life if you are a sane person. 

This is where Richard comes into the picture. He was a petty thief and a drug addict, who always wanted to sell stuff to my mum (yes, probably some of it was stolen, never asked my mom whether she bought something from him ever. I like to belive she hasn’t, as I never saw police officers in the store). So one time my mom was picking out the cash from the cashier to take it to the bank, when Richard comes in to ask some questions. He took a good opportunity to steal my moms wallet and her phone. My mom didn't press charges because she didn’t have money for a lawyer, but she managed to get back some of the money and her phone, but she lost at least 1600 dollar worth of money. Needless to say, it was a really big shock for our family. But because we were just little kids, we didn't know about this at that time.

Time went by, and I'm going to high school and two things happened. First of all MF's house got completely destroyed. You know, MFF had this thing called ’re-cycling’ money. He always borrowed and lent money and I think that time he was late with repayment, so one of the guys he owed hired some other dude to destroy his house as revenge. Guess who was the lucky guy who got the job… That’s right, it was Richard! He never got caught by the police in this case, but he payed too many visits in MFFs hamburger restaurant asking questions about the invastigation. After some time, it was so obvious that this idiot did it, but there was not enough evidence to prove it. But this time, he got a biiiig enemy and it didn't take a long time to unveil Richard’s drug businesses. So, eventually he turned out to be a stupid petty criminal and got 8 years in prison for not even the worst thing he has ever done. MFF had a contact, who had a contact in prison who wrote letters every month about the guys in local businesses who got caught and sent behind bars. This will be important later.

The second thing that happened, my mom got a new husband. A husband, who, by chance, worked in prison as the wise chief physician. And because my mom has attented nursing school long ago (hasn't finished it because of the marriage to my father) my new stepfather got her a new job in the prison’s medical department.

By this point, Richard almost completely lost all his mind because of the drugs (yes, he was still on drugs, even in prison) and couldn't even recognise my mom. I mean... he could, but not quite. For some reason, he tought she was her doctor, back in the town! He said big hellos to her and told her things like ""Hey Doctor! Doctor! Do you recognise me? I was your patient in town!!"" etc. At one point, my mom lost it, looked around, and the next conversation unfolded:

\- Richard shut up! I was not your doctor! I was never a doctor! You know me because one time you robbed me!

\- But... no... no I never...

\- Yes you did! Now shut up, and go back to your place!

Richard was in shock, so he just looked down to the floor and obeyed. Now, there is one important rule in the prison: be friends with everyone in the medical department, because they have all the medicine and drugs! Two really big guys heard the conversation, so they went to my mom and asked her:

\- Should we... you know... reward him?

My mom looked around. No guards nearby. She quietly answered:

\- You should...  but, just a little. \*winks\*

The two guys nodded, and when the guards came back, these two stood around Richard as they all left the medical department.

Do you remeber the letter thing? Well, a little time passed, and Richard’s name came up somehow in a conversation between me and MF. He told me this:

\- Something has happened to him in prison. My father said that in those letters there has been just one sentence about Richard in the past few months: ""He stretches nicely"".

I had just joined a new charter school for my Sophomore year, I had just turned 15 at the time and I was new to my High School and one of my classes for the new school year was Spanish. Now, as a Mexican, I am ashamed to not know Spanish so I took the class to help myself communicate with my family. Our Spanish teacher was a nice, old woman and we shall call her Mrs. Sanchez for protective reasons. She had been born in South America and was a native Spanish speaker but had moved to America to get her teaching degree. For the first week, she had been a pretty nice old lady. She was fun, a bit hard to understand with her accent but fun nonetheless.

However, later on, about 2 or 3 weeks into the school year, she was teaching Spanish oddly. Some of the things that stick in my mind that she said was that the letter W wasn’t in the Spanish alphabet. (It is, it just isn’t used or pronounced in Spanish often.) Well, these things had been bothering the class for quite a while. Just across from the high school is an elementary that is part of the same district. The  elementary goes from Kindergarten to 8th grade. From there, the 8th grader can graduate and come to our high school for their 4 years of high school.

Anyway, Ms. Sanchez’s class was mainly a Freshman and Sophomore year class. Freshman and Sophomores much like me, noticed Sanchez’s incorrect way of Spanish and many of those students went to the elementary to complain. They went to the main Spanish teacher there. She was loved by practically every student there. Not only that, she was my aunt. Let's call her Mrs. Moreno. Mrs. Moreno (hailing from Mexico and a native speaker) was my aunt who taught at the elementary school. Many of her past kids complained to her but I was the one to go and burst Mrs. Sanchez's bubble. I finally complained to my mom about the Spanish I was being taught and fed up, my mom decided to talk to her sister, my aunt, Mrs. Moreno, about this.

As you can expect, to hear all these complaints and then a complaint from her nephew, Mrs. Moreno raised hell. As far as I’ve been told, Mrs. Moreno didn’t want to waste any time with dealing with a faulty teacher. From what I know, Mrs. Moreno went and complained to the Administration/Superintendents, about a teacher teaching students things completely wrong. For the entire first semester, we had to deal with Mrs. Sanchez, we heard her talking and teaching us all wrong but I had known it was a matter of time before she was gone. The rest of the class, as you can guess, was clueless of what was to come and only moaned as she taught us wrong the entire first semester.

Then, it happened. We had just released for Winter Break. 2 weeks of no school and us just kicking back and enjoying our holiday season. I dreaded the first day going back but something was up. We, the students had walked into that class only to notice things missing. There were masses of items that were gone that had belonged to Mrs. Sanchez, the class was practically barren. We had a sub that day. And the next day. Until on the 3rd after we returned, I questioned my mom. That was when she laid it all out for me. Mrs. Moreno had gotten Ms. Sanchez fired with all of her complaints. Had the students kept complaining, my aunt said she would just thought Ms. Sanchez was hard on the students. It wasn’t until I made my complaint of what she was doing wrong that my aunt took action. I single-handedly got a teacher fired because of my complaint. I’m 17 now and sometimes I wonder Sanchez is doing nowadays. I wonder if she got her teaching license revoked.

On mobile, sorry about formatting and English isn't my first language. 

Backstory, I was friends with this guy. For the sake of privacy we'll call him Josh. Josh was weird, he really liked feet. I didn't really care 'cause he can like whatever he wants. Josh also really REALLY liked attention, prefferably bad attention. He LOVED it when people leaked stuff of his, let people break in on his instagram and made them leak things for ""revenge"" (discovered that quite late). There was a whole app group for people that didn't like him. He hurted a lot of people, mostly girls. (I am female aswell) 

Now to the story. 
I was chilling in my living room when I get a text from Josh. He tells me he used me and never liked me. I was very mad since I was always there caring for Josh. He told me that I could take revenge on him. He had send me nudes in the past and knew I had some ""dirt"" on him. 
He send me his log in on insta, but I did something else than he wanted. Instead of humiliating him, giving him the attention he wanted, I permanently deleted his insta account. He was PISSED. He told me he never meant what he said and just wanted me to do that for his own pleasure. I got even madder and told him he could suck his toe. 

I went into the app group of people that didn't like him, told him what I did and they where in on it. 
Since John didn't learn from his mistake, he kept sending his log in to people that disliked him. We all deleted his accounts. Account popped up, account got deleted and so on.

Yes, I know I’m a shitty person. Also, this is gonna be a long one.

When I was around 6 or 7, I made a friend with a kid that lived right next to me. Let’s call him Drake. Drake was a super nice kid and we would hang out all the time in the summer whenever he would go to his grandparents house (His grandparents house and my house were connected through backyards). Everything was great for a while until I learned just how bad his family life was and why he would stay at his grandparents. His dad was in and out of jail due to being in a gang and his mom constantly OD’d on sleeping pills so he would have to stay at his grandparents due to a lack of parenting. Despite this, D was a very kind and energetic kid. That was, till about 4th grade. He all of a sudden started doing things that were extremely alarming for a fourth grader to be doing such as smoking cigarettes and swearing every other sentence even in front of adults. Due to this, my parents wouldn’t allow me to hang out with him anymore so the only time I would talk to him was at school. We stayed decent friends through middle school, stopping to talk with each other every now and then. That is, until 9th grade. I was an idiot freshman and wanted to get a vape because everybody was getting one. He offered to sell me his for 40 dollars (I later found out it was only worth about 20 dollars) which I happily accepted since I trusted him. He took my money and left. At first, I thought he was just going to go get it so I waited there for a bit until it was obvious that he wasn’t coming back. I was confused and really nervous because this was all in school and I was scared he got caught. I kept dismissing the idea that he stole the money because I didn’t want to believe that he was following in his dad’s footsteps. I walk around until I find him in the bathroom and ask if he has it to which he responds with “I don’t know what you talkin’ about”. I told him that he still had to give me the vape. what happened next made my heart sink. He got right up in my face and said “You better stop right there before I silence you myself”. I was pretty devastated. He just threatened to beat me up over 40 fucking dollars. I wish that was the end of it but that was only the begining. Over the course of the next 3 years he would get up in my face and threaten to beat the shit out of me when there wasn’t anyone around but his deadbeat friends. He even threw a glass bottle at my head one time which hit me in the back of the head and left a big welt. I didn’t say a thing because he both owned a gun (illegally), knew where I lived, and for some dumb reason I didn’t want to snitch on him because I felt bad for him. That was, until last year.  At this point, I am a Senior in high school and I was stopping by the nearest gas station because I needed a phone charger. Turns out Drake works at that gas station and when I walk in, he instantly starts accusing me of things I didn’t do in order to atart something with me so I start trying to leave. Him and his Goon of a friend follow me out and start taking practice swings at my while I’m calmly walking back to my car. As I climb in, they spit on my car and start hitting it. That was it. I was gonna hurt this kid. So I waited. I waited and waited until the chance came frolicking into my arms. The day I was sick from school. Something huge happened at our school. His sister got stabbed four times in the middle of the hallway (shes okay now). This was my chance. I spent over 3 hours asking around until someone sent me the video of the whole thing. I posted it on R/holdmyfeedingtube and in under 24 hours, it had 10,000 upvotes. I watched as people made fun of his sister in the comments and smiled.

To the mid-1950s in fact. My father's office was right across the street from my school, and because his regular hours meshed well with my school hours I usually rode with him in the mornings, rather than take the bus.  One morning there was a pep rally or some such event in front of the school, as we approached from the rear. An arrogant stupid cop (ASC) was blocking the street on the side of the school when my father tried to make a turn to reach his parking lot.  ASC told him to take it around the block. My father explained that he was just going to the parking lot about half way down the street, well away from the crowd in front of the school. ASC repeated ""Take it on around the block."" Soon after I left the car and from then on this account is from my father. He drove around several blocks and eventually reached his reserved parking space via an alley on the other side of the blocked street. This is where ASC made his stupid mistake.  Seeing my father pulling into his parking space ASC walked across the street and told my father, ""Listen, Buddy, when I tell you to do something, you do it."" This jerk should have considered the fact that the building across from the school was the Federal Building and that you might think twice about verbally assaulting someone with a reserved space in the Federal Building parking lot. My father was a treasury agent. In fact he was in charge of collections for the IRS in a large area in the northwest corner of the state. In practice his badge trumped the cop's badge by a couple orders of magnitude. A subsequent investigation revealed that ASC, like many law officers, took private security gigs during off duty hours.  Wonder of wonder not a penny of that income was ever reported.  That's tax evasion, a federal felony, the same thing they got Al Capone on. I doubt that ASC ever served prison time, but he sure got a hefty bill for unpaid taxes, plus penalty and interest.

So I live in an area with lots of parking issues. There is always something going on and parking can be very tight. I happen to have a house with a large parking lot where we can fit 6-8 cars and lots of friends come to park at my house when there are events going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I happened to be out running errands while one such event was going on. Came home to my house and found a mini van parking in what could be two spots (I have a truck and could park kind of up a slight embankment if the mini van hadnt parked about 4 feet away from the car to its right.) Thinking this is probably one of my wifes friends I just park behind the van and my wifes vehicle (also blocking in 2 other vehicles I recognized) and take off for the event to meet everyone (errand I was running was to get the finals things for a big group dinner.) 

&amp;#x200B;

A while later one of my buddies and I walk back home to get the grill started for dinner and see a big tow truck in my driveway. As I am walking up this totally pissed off dude is yelling at the tow truck driver and I walk up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Whats going on here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tow truck guy: Is this your house? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: Why in the fuck did you park me in? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Because this is my house and I can park wherever the hell I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No this is NOT your house. I am good friends with (old owner) and he said I could park here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tow truck driver: Can I leave? This guy said a car was blocking him in at his house but cannot show me proof that he lives here. And sir? (to pissed off guy) We have your credit card number and will be charging a fee to come over here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No way are you going to be charging me. This guy is blocking me in on my friends property. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: When did you talk to your friend and ask him if you could park here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: I called him last night and let him know I was coming up here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Did you talk to him in person? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: No I left him a message. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Oh.....so he couldnt have told you that I bought this house from him almost 6 years ago. I guess you guys are really good buddies huh? To the tow truck guy: You are good to leave. (and he goes back to his truck.) So I guess you are pretty fucked now huh? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pissed off guy: Fuck you!! Move your car or I am calling the cops!! Our wives are waiting for us to pick them and our kids up. (Hadnt noticed that another guy got out of the van.)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: No. (Buddy walks over and hands me a beer.) I will move my truck when I feel like it. You parked on my property. No one can get me to move my vehicle if I dont want to. (I walk over to start the grill and talk to my buddy while listening to how much of a f\*cking A$$hole I am.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Sane friend walks over: Hey. Can I pay you a parking fee or something and get you to move your car? Sorry he is being such an ahole.....he's my brother in law so unfortunately family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Fine. Give me $100 and you can get out of here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guy opens wallet and hands me $100 and I throw my buddy keys to move my truck so they can get out. Now why did I have him move it? I was busy calling another buddy.....who was a cop just stationed down the road from me. Called and filled him in and he came right around the corner from my house (where he couldnt be seen) and I went out to antagonize the jerk again. Still yelling as he pulled out onto the public road.....oops!!

&amp;#x200B;

Cop walks over and flags him down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cop: What seems to be the problem.....sir am I smelling alcohol on your breath? 

&amp;#x200B;

Blew over and was cuffed and put in the back of a patrol car. His BIL blew, was sober and was allowed to take the mini van but before he left he walked up to me and said: I thought you gave up way too easy. You made this happen didnt you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Maaaybe. Do you think it will teach him to be less of an asshole when he is the one in the wrong? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory: He’s 79 and kicking but isn’t in the best shape anymore. He was drafted into the army while in highschool and then enlisted in the  navy afterwards. Before I was born he was honorably discharged, and until I was about two he was getting a criminal justice degree, and then went on to be the sheriff of the county he lives in. He retired probably 4-6 years ago. My grandma also worked in the army (she had a desk job, I don’t know the specifics) and retired three years before my grandpa did. So they make a decent amount in pensions (not a lot, but enough to pay taxes on the house that’s been in my grandma’s family for a few generations, and enough to spoil us grandkids when we come visit, as grandparents do). It will be important to note, later in the story, that I have an uncle who lives in the same town as my grandpa and is currently a deputy for the police department. 

Anyways, on to the story. So maybe four years ago (I was just fourteen) my grandpa decided he wanted a shed. He’s a big wood-working guy, and makes benches and bookshelf’s and nightstands etc. etc. in his free time, but he isn’t in shape to build a structure even with the help of my cousins. So he decided to hire this guy, who we’ll call John. He liked hiring local, and this guy was from the small town my grandpa was from and still lives in. When my grandpa hires john(in winter) he says he’ll start construction at the beginning of spring (where we live, this is usually when the weather allows, as it snows well into “spring” some years) and he’ll have the construction done by the end of fall. He gives my grandpa a quote (I don’t know the amount exactly). My grandpa is excited to have a little work shop of his own (and so is my grandma because she doesn’t like all the noise the saws and drills make when he works in the basement). Spring rolls around, and John doesn’t show. My grandpa already had to pay a small portion upfront, so he’s a little pissed, and calls John to ask where he is. John says he got another contracting project out of town and it will be a bit before he can get to my grandfathers shed. 
He didn’t come until October. 
Due to the weather in the state I live in, that meant construction couldn’t really start. He got the foundation down, and that was it. My grandpa is a little pissed but understands, hey, this local guy got a big gig, not a big deal. 
It takes this guy three years to finish the shed. So my grandpa’s pissed, understandably, but doesn’t say anything to John. He pays John what John quoted him, plus additional costs because of the time it took. But he calls the company that gave John a contracting permit to file an official report against him (I don’t know how this works and I might be getting this part wrong). It goes without a hitch, he thinks it’s over, right? 
Wrong.

On my cousin’s graduation that year, John, uninvited, shows up and tells my grandpa he still owes 6k, my grandpa basically told him to come back on a different day because my cousin is more important. 
That night he got an email from John’s lawyer. It was something along the lines of 
“You still owe John and johns wife (let’s call her jill) 6k that hasn’t been paid.” 
My grandpa responds with “send me an invoice.” He instantly got in touch with his lawyer. 
He doesn’t get an electronic invoice, but two days later gets a letter on his doorstep with a note inside signed by Jill saying “you still owe 6k,” with the original quote attached, but the cost whited out so there was an additional nearly 10k added. 
So he sends the original copy of the quote, along with the letter from Jill, as well as a printed copy of the email from John and Jill’s lawyer, to his lawyer, and talks to my uncle (we’ll call him Dave).
So Dave starts asking people offhand about John, and starts bringing John up to his work friends, before finding out that a few years prior John had been reported for theft, but the case hadn’t went anywhere. Dave digs a little and finds more and more police reports saying that John has repeatedly stolen from people around the town, as well as failed to pay the teens he hires over summer (the pd couldn’t deal with this so that’s why no arrests had been made, as they’re all matters that need to be settled in court). Dave starts making a small file full of copies of the reports. 
Meanwhile my grandpas lawyer is trying to sort out this issue with out my grandpa needing to go to court. My grandpa gets a “discount” that lowers the 6k still owed to about 4.5k, but my grandpa is still livid. And after taking to Dave, he decides he’s going to take it to court. 
My grandpa goes to court with his lawyer, and has both the small packet from Dave as well as his own records. I wasn’t there for the trial so I cant say exactly what happened, but Dave had to pay out 10k plus some to my grandpa, as well as numerous other fees to various other clients and employees, had to do community service work (I don’t remember how much), and got his contracting license permanently revoked. Last I heard from John and Jill had moved out of the county, and John was working as a cashier somewhere due to the fact that he couldn’t become a contractor and hadn’t gone to school for anything else. 
Since then he’s found some sketchy spots in the structure, but nothing major, so with the help of my oldest cousin (19) they can usually fix the problems before they get bad.

My mom is living proof, especially since she's not a really a vengeance minded person (I am, but I don't get that from her). That said, my mom's tough. She's had to put up with a lot of shit over the years, particularly from some breathtakingly shitty men, one of whom I have to share half my genetics with. So if you're interested, here's the story of how my parents' divorce turned out.

My dad's a dick and has always been threatened by any success or indication that my mom might be better than him at something. They used to have a business together and she was the one that got everybody paid. That bruised his ego. After two kids, two moves, and several years of him behaving like an apocalyptic fuckhat, my parents separate and later divorce. Unfortunately, my petty tendencies came from somewhere and that somewhere was my sperm donor.

Divorce is never easy or fun, but this was about as pleasant as a barbed wire buttplug. On the legal and financial end, trying to get any cooperation or child support was like squeezing blood from a stone. For us kids, he had joint custody where he put no effort into bonding with us and mostly dumped him on his new girlfriend and eventual wife (who is ten years younger than him). She's an unholy hellbitch to me and my sibling and he can't be arsed to care too much about that. To make things extra miserable, dad and his new succubus spend a healthy amount of time telling us that our mother is evil and trying to take us away from him. And we should stop telling her anything that happens at their house. There's a lot more to unpack, but it mostly belongs under RBN or JustNoFamily.

Now where's my mother in all of this? Doing her fucking best. She does everything she can to protect me and my sibling from all this bullshit. But she can't take us away from our dad. From the court's perspective, there's nothing wrong with our dad: he's gainfully employed, has no arrest record, no addictions, and isn't physically abusing us. If she tried to take us away, the court would rule against her, seeing her as just a bitter ex-wife trying to fuck over her ex. And me and my sibling were pretty brainwashed at this point; if she tried to tell us what our dad was doing was wrong, we would have just seen this as proof that all the horrible things our dad had been telling us were true. So my mom did her best to take the high road and support us through the worst years of our lives.

Fortunately, I do take after my mom at least a little and finally stood up for myself. Shortly after I turned fourteen, I started refusing to go to my father's house. My sibling followed suit. We were old enough that the court had to take our opinions in account and couldn't force us to see our father. I have not set foot in that house for over a decade and it still remains the best decision I have ever made (which is more than I can say for most fourteen year olds - no shade, but everyone does stupid shit at that age, myself included).

No why is this my mom's revenge? Well, one of my dad's worst fears was realized without him even realizing it (not exactly difficult, he has the self-awareness of hemorrhoid): my mom is better than him. A better spouse, a better ex, a better parent, a better person, and she managed to do all this without him, in spite of him. She is the best parent I could have ever asked for and I am incredible lucky, especially since plenty of people don't even get ONE good parent. For all the misery my worthless sack of pigshit of a father dragged us through, he will never get what he really wants: my mother as a miserable failure. Deep down, he know he's lost.

My mom is much better off this days. Her kids are getting launched and her longtime boyfriend has moved in. She has a successful business, a cute dog, and a partner who buys her flowers and makes her laugh like a lunatic.

And my dad? My sibling talks to him very sporadically and I haven't spoken to the cum rag since 2013, in a phone call that involved raised voices and expletives. And he's still married to that cock-juggling thundercunt I call my stepmother. Last I heard about their relationship, she's prone to publicly berating him at work events in front all his colleagues. 

TLDR: My dad is shitty husband, a worse ex, and an equally bad father. Mom takes the high road and now he's stuck married to the hell harpy that is his second wife and neither of his kids will speak to him.",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,929747,public,self,My mom is the unintentional master of pro-revenge,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/f33uid/my_mom_is_the_unintentional_master_of_prorevenge/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I had been there for quite some time and had seen many managers, both good and bad, come and go. They typically lasted just a couple of years.

We had been gifted a general manager who was sent to our store as his last chance to salvage his career and when he failed, we were without a general manager for a couple of months. The assistant managers ran the restaurant and things were ok. But no one was getting promoted within the company.

Then the district manager went with an outside hire that was coming in from the other side of the country. This guy was a complete idiot. We'll call him Johnny. He had zero experience as a general manager and wasn't even applying for the position, but the district manager talked him into taking the job. Big mistake.

Under Johnny's tutelage, our Emerald Wednesday started to slowly fail, mostly due to his mismanagement. He was belligerent to the staff, making a couple of the girls cry by belittling them in front of everyone else. He was so lazy he'd hide in the office on busy weekends while we struggled without a manager. He refused to do even the basics of his job, like the nightly pull-thaw.

For those who don't know, many things are kept frozen in the walk-in freezer and are pulled forward to the cooler at night so that they thaw before morning. This was rarely done on Johnny's evening shifts. We would routinely have to force-thaw steaks, shrimp and chicken under running cold water, which is not something that we're supposed to even do.

I saw on a few occasions that Johnny was cross-contaminating foods under the running water, a pan of frozen shrimp sitting on top of or even in a pan of frozen steaks. At one point, (I didn't see this one), Johnny ran some frozen steaks under hot water to thaw them quickly because they needed to be cooked RIGHT THEN. This was a HUGE problem and had I seen it, I'd have wanted to punch the fool in his face.

We sometimes ran checks of multiple hours and had frequent guest complaints. One guest even threw his silverware at the host. Johnny was called up front and actually took the guest's side, leaving the host in tears. I believe he even compted the guy's meal.

Johnny was a real class act. I made it my mission to do something about him. At the very least he was going to get someone very ill from his shenanigans.

So I sat down with the district manager (who had brought Johnny in), and spoke with him at length and great detail about how bad Johnny was, how terrible the morale was, how he could get people ill, all of it. He asked me point blank what I thought of Johnny and I told him ""Johnny is an idiot."" 

Nothing came of it.

Christmas was coming and I knew I was quitting in a couple of months. Johnny insisted on having a Christmas party at a bar a town away, but fraternizing between management and hourly employees was against company policy, so I didn't go. Johnny got quite drunk and drove himself home. I heard from co-workers that Johnny had been pulled over for a DUI. Oops.

A week or so later, I wrote a lengthy email detailing everything Johnny has screwed up on, wrote about the Christmas party and included screenshots of court records I was able to look up on the town's website. I set up a burner email account and messaged everyone I could find in the Emerald Wednesday hierarchy.

When I went back to work a couple days later, we had a shiny new general manager, and no one knew what I had done. I am not proud of this, but he was making lives miserable, the restaurant was failing, and I was certain he was a public health risk.

In July, my elderly neighbor had her grandson, and pregnant girlfriend, move in “to help them out”. She is a widowed lady in her seventies. Babbles a lot, but sweet.

I have a soft spot for her. Years ago, she cornered me as I was leaving to take my dog on a walk. My dog was unhappily pacing waiting for the walk while we listened to her stories. He peed on her during the story; she is so senile she didn’t notice. 

Just a few days later, I am mowing my backyard and the grandson walks past my house carrying an amazon envelope. Weird. An hour later, sweet little old lady comes over. With the envelope her grandson had. “This was in my landscaping”. 

Totally forgot I ordered my kids the movie “Leap”. (What a shit haul for this kid.)

See I am a criminal defense attorney. Probably the only one this lady knows. If I call the cops, my neighbor will try to hire me. It will get weird. She is so sweet. I will be a witness. He is on probation, so he will sit in jail for a while. This will totally make me look like a snitch to my own clients in that same jail who are thieves, addicts, and burglars. It’s bad personally and professionally. And it’s not the biggest deal. 

So I filled up an Amazon box with “purple rain powder” that was ordered to my office. A dry dye that gets darker and spreads when it comes into contact with your sweat. That lasts a week on your skin. Think leaking pen, times fifty. 

Why? I want to shame him, and it won’t come back on me. He’s not gonna call the cops for stealing my shit. He isn’t gonna tell his grandma he stole from me. And if it makes a mess in her house, it’s still cheaper for her then hiring a lawyer and paying her grandsons court costs and fines. 

Yep, package was gone in 20 minutes. 

I walk past the home; screams of anger at the pregnant girlfriend “this shit won’t come off” “it’s all over my grandmas house”. Priceless.

Now I am not going to hide his name because he should be proud of himself. At first me and Austin were great friends and would eat lunch together and hang out and talk about cool cartoon shows like Chowder,KND,etc.(best cartoons ever btw) and got along great but one day a new transfer student came to our school from the UK and Austin started picking on him. I was infuriated with him and told him so and he pushed me and said so what you are a loser anyway and walked off. Now I am a kind person and never get into fights so I just let him go.

A week passes and one day we are in PE running laps when I pass Austin and am now in first place. Suddenly he gained speed and pushed me into a ditch that went around the track and I landed on my arm! At first I was so angry I didn't notice it broke(probably adrenaline?) and walked out of the ditch to see all the others kids screaming and running from me. I was confused and just so happen to look down and seem my arm dangling. I start freaking out screaming and the coach comes to see whats wrong. When she sees it she has the school call 911 and I am taken to the hospital.

When I come back from the hospital a week later and participate school again Austin would make fun of me calling me a cripple and his goons would make jokes. Later that day I get called to the office and tell them about the whole incident and they talked to Austin and in the end said they couldn't do anything because the track is behind the school and to far from the camera's views and I had no evidence. I then got an idea and asked everyone who was there if they saw what happened and I asked for written statements of the event after 3 days I have 13 statements and give them to the principal who then calls the students and gives interviews after this he then calls Austin and tells him he is suspended for a week.

I make them pay money to other services but when its all said and done they will loose out of tuition paying students.

I graduated high school and I was ready for life! I applied to colleges and got accepted. I started comparing financials and it seemed that one school just made sense. I contact the VP of finance at another school that was closer to home and he promised in writing that they will match the financials as the cheaper school. 

Great! I pack my car up hop in and drive 8 hours away from my life. I get into the dorm and sit down. Im in college. My life is about to be awesome! 

Three months down the road, I get a bill for over $25k due in 10 days. Wait. My eyes got huge! “What is this bull shit” i ask myself. I immediately get on the phone with a financial counselor and explain the situation. She doesn’t know whats going on so I get bounced to another and to another and back and forth for over a year. Meanwhile the VP himself has disappeared from all of existence, but only for me. To everyone else he’s readily available. On too of it all, everyone is getting emails about how the school “accidentally” overcharged sales tax and we’re all getting a refund. Not to mention no name charges on accounts that if you ask them about what its for they will just take it off and not explain. I warned other students about this activity and it seems to be a campus wide problem. I asked alumni and they agreed that this school has a bogus financial system and they try to cheat students out of money. 

So, i make the decision that im going to make this school pay. They wont be paying me but they will be paying others. I start off with throwing cake on a campus safety vehicle. Great they’ll waste money on some guy washing that off. Whats next. I’ll smoke bomb the dorms. Get the deans all riled up and make them pay to get the smoke out of the hallway. (No residents were evacuated for that one).

What could be even better. How about turning the seal on a water pip in the middle of the night at a building and make them pay for all the emergency services that came! That cost them a good $8k. 

I could throw detergent into the fountain? Check. Another couple thousand there. 

I began to think how I can really make a bigger difference. Not only make them pay monetarily but also in public relations. I taught myself computer programming, but im a business major. At this point im only a sophomore and nobody is going to hire me to do anything really important like that! 

So i make a plan. I’ll start off with maintenance jobs, male my way up to something like a computer lab manager or a computer science TA... and then get some exposure like that! 

Fast forward 2 years of dumb jobs and kissing ass, and I get an email for a job offer. An Admin Web Developer! I was so excited! I can finally make a real dent! Maybe even a gaping hole! Maybe a huge gaping holy grail glory hole!! 

I get hired and the first day on the job i make some spelling error on the front page. Everyone panics and is calling out office left and right. I fix it eventually. Ok lets change the picture of the VP to some super old ugly dude. Done. More phone calls more PR panics. Well how about inserting a lil bug? No. I dont wanna screw others over. Lets try a redirect!? Yes! A redirect to.. 

i stop myself. I dont want to do that quite yet but in a semester when I graduate... (insert universitynamehere).edu is going to pornhub. I’ll keep you updated but so far i’ve calculated, I got the school to pay at least $20k to some other kind individuals, and about $5k on their own employees through wasted time investing and cleaning etc. Now they might loose a heck of a lot more if this institution gets redirected to a not so family friendly website.

I was driving down a small country road with a 45mph speed limit that some choose to ignore. And coming up behind me was a standard work truck (I won't name names but it was a popular automotive parts store delivery truck) and got right on my bumper I'm in not in a tiny car but it's a sedan and he was so close that all I saw was grill and hood in my mirrors. While I stayed doing the speed limit, after about 3 mins he decided that a sharp curve was the perfect time to pass me and surprise surprise there was a car coming after the curve. He swerved at me and I slammed the brakes nearly missing his bumper.

Thankfully I had this all on dashcam, front and back. I got home later and got the footage on my laptop and called their 1800 number with his plate number and his truck number. The woman I spoke to was SUPER apologetic and she asked me to send her the video. She watched it while on the line with me and immediately asked if she could put me on hold. I said yes and a few minutes go by and she gets back and brings me someone else on the line. The local store manager of that driver. She had sent him the video and the manager apologized a ton and promised me right then and there that employee was terminated for that behavior.


A few weeks go by and I don't hear anything till a friend of mine on Facebook sends me a link, the driver that was fired managed to get my name from his HR or manager or something and was trying to find me IRL because he lost his job and made a video wearing his work uniform threatening violence on me because of everything. I went to my local PD station about it and showed them the video and explained everything and was told I needed to speak to that company again because they let my name get out. I called them and told them everything going on and I was told I'd get a call from their HR department within 2-3 business days. Literally 6 hours later I received a call from some higher up HR person with one of their legal team on the phone. They wanted me to sign a document stating I won't publicly go after them or give negative PR if they Sue him for me and get restraining order and everything on this guy for what he threatened. They even offered to have a lawyer of my chosing go over it with me at no cost to me and sign it and have them handle it.

Another few more weeks go by and that friend on Facebook (he knows that guys family or something) said that the dudes mom posted some sob story that her son is going through some expensive court case that he likely won't win because the other team is over 10 lawyers.

So not only lost his job but then tried to find me only to have his ex-employer sue him. Lol",True,False,False,ProRevenge,t5_2vjvl,929907,public,self,Delivery driver gets his karma....

I am Mr. Wiggly Wiggles and I am here to wiggle up your day with a story on some sweet revenge.                              Before I begin, just a few things.

1.) This is all true

2.) Because of my police encounters, I lost my good nature and thirst for sweet bloody revenge.

3.) I do not care if this is illegal or not. Revenge is revenge. No way to sugar it up.                                                      To sleep with a guy means you are sleeping with a guy. Calling them a girl does not change that.                          Same goes with revenge, no matter what the excuse is.

With that said, let's begin.

This very demonic old man moved into the house next door. That is not an over exaggeration.                              He was always hateful, grouchy, and rude. At night, he will be in the backyard, doing chants and rituals in robes. From what was known, he practiced an old form of Pagan Witchcraft and he would try to summon demons with blood sacrifices. 

Ever since he moved in, the neighborhood's animals and pets started to go missing.                                               No trace, no evidence, nothing...  

My family raises chickens and even a few of them went missing.                                                                                  So I borrowed some security cameras from a friend and we had them set to watch my chicken coop and record. 

I was surprised to see the footage on the cameras of my neighbor stealing my chickens.                                     At first, we all thought it was an animal. Never thought it was him.                                                                                To make it worse, my friend and I started spying on him. One night, we were spying through his basement window. He was sacrificing the pets he stole, while chanting, and dancing on a pentagram circle. Even black candles were lit every single corner of the room.   

In his basement, he was sacrificing. So my friend and I decided to have some fun. This wasn't just revenge, but as a simple prank as well. 

First Night, we slashed his tires on his car. My friend pained a demonic symbol on the front of his car as well. 

Second Night, we Gorilla Glued his back and front door shut. Also, painted the same demonic symbol on his doors.

Third Night, we moved his mailbox to his backyard and left a letter in it. The envelope had the demonic symbol on it and the letter read, ""Release me!"" 

Fourth Night, we sprayed paint the demonic symbol all over his house and yard. 

Fifth Night, we had these recording devices that will playing walking sounds and demonic noises.                       We hid them outside his house very well. My friend and I was in my bedroom watching out the window. The devices were remote control, so once in a while we would press them. He will come outside, find nothing wrong. Go back in, and then we did it again. 

Awhile after, the police shows up to his house. He called the police about this noise. Police searched and found nothing. 

Sixth Night, he was outside for the entire night walking around. He was paranoid from that point on.

Seventh Night, he was inside. My friend and I reclaimed all our devices. We also left a note on his backdoor that read, ""WE WANT YOUR SOUL!"" 

After that, he left. The guy did not pack his stuff, did not take anything, he just left for good.                               Because a week or so later, a moving truck came by and started gathering all his stuff up.                                         We never saw this guy again.

Only if he didn't steal my chickens. 

Now that I think about it, what if he released a demon and that demon made me do all of this.                             I might think that I did, when I really didn't.

Please feel free to delete it and I will try to find more suitable sub to ask this.

On to the story: Ever since the last few months there is this guy that used to be a customer at our business. He was unhappy about the amount of time that he had to wait for his documents, he requested to cut ties with us. We happily obliged, as this doesn't happen often for us, and usually people that cut ties are really difficult people.

Well, soon afterwards it became true: He started collecting emails of us and our partners and even remotely connected people to us and began harrasing us all each day, 4-5 times per day. The thing is, this guy seems as a rather unstable person. His emails are full of twisting of the truth, sharing company secrets (not only ours, but others as well), really defamating one or two of my colleagues, as well as writing total nonsense. For instance: ""I have had only 3 items, not 5. But dude, our system show all of your logs and activities and except for our main admin (me) not a single soul can do them in your place.""

Due to the life threatening content in some of the emails, we went to the authorities and they basically advised us and didn't pursue any action. The advise: request him to provide a public retraction and to say sorry publicly. He didn't. That action only added gas to the fire. 

So, I really want to be petty and all those kinds of adjectives and use this guys email address to do something to him. We all blocked him on our personal addresses, but he keeps on finding others and keeps harassing them. Please reddit, give me your best revenge to a person like this!
